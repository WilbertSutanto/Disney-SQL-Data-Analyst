There are some that are so special to me. Including the original Parent Trap. Such great memories with that movie. Also, if there are movies I've missed out on I can watch those. For instance, I was not able to go to the theaters when the new Aladdin movie came out. It was awesome to get to watch it in the comfort of my home. Popped popcorn, had snacks. It was great, lol. Love the variety. It's nice to be able to view movies when I want and according to what I'm in the mood for. Thumbs up!\n",

I don't like that every company has to have a streaming platform but so Far Disney+ is at an affordable price and doesn't destroy my budget. However this service is constantly buffering and freezing at times so frequently I have to just give up. I would think that a company worth as much as Disney would have higher quality streaming. Aside from the lag I'm pretty happy with the service.\n",

Disney Plus is starting to introduce homosexual themed content intended for children to watch and have exposure to. I understand homosexuality is a complex social issue, but Disney should NOT be taking it upon themselves to expose and indoctrinate children to this kind of behavior via animation. For thousands of years, the traditional family has been the fundamental unit of society and teaching young children that these societal trends are ever changing only creates more questions and confusion, especially inside homes where traditional Judeo-Christian family values are taught.\n",

After my free Verizon period ended my bill went up $3.07. When I was talking to the online representative I had to ask for a supervisor multiple times. They would not honor the prepaid period, and said that they would take my prepayment and spread it over the 3 years. When I finally got the supervisor on the chat he was not helpful at all either. The content on Disney+ is ok, but when you compare to other providers, and having several service providers available, we can’t pay for them all (nor do we need them). The under $4/month was reasonable, but the way they handled my account was not. Check your bills.\n",

I find that very surprising and don't believe that my 4K LG smart TV is unable to download the Disney Plus app. I already have Netflix and some other apps downloaded, but when I typed in Disney Plus the app didn't populate. My keyboard menu on the TV doesn't have the actual \"+\" sign. She said without that symbol I can't download Disney Plus. Other info she gave me seemed very suspicious as well. She told me that Disney Plus doesn't have and has never offered a 7-day free trial. However, right on their website they mention a 7-day free trial. She also said the price per month in Cdn. dollars has always been $8.99, even though a co-worker said he had Disney Plus 4 months ago for $6.99 (and the rate is listed as $6.99 on their website).\n",

Today, 9 months later, I called in to ask why my subscription was automatically being renewed and I was told that the free month was never awarded and I would not get it. I asked why nobody contacted me like they said they would and they said they closed the file months ago without informing me.

The movies it has are ok in itself but I feel like Disney has a gazillion dollar’s time spend and the platform sucks. You can’t preview any movies. The titles are so small you have to actually click on a movie to see what it’s about. How is it that no one can fix that? Netflix platform is amazing! Anyway other than that I don’t really care much for it. Sorry.\n",

If you can early release Frozen 2 then you can early release the other movies.\n",

I understand homosexuality is a complex social issue, but Disney should NOT be taking it upon themselves to expose and indoctrinate children to this kind of behavior via animation. For thousands of years, the traditional family has been the fundamental unit of society and teaching young children that these societal trends are ever changing only creates more questions and confusion, especially inside homes where traditional Judeo-Christian family values are taught.\n",

As a business owner, you are only as good as your customer service team. I ended up canceling the so-called bundle. I have an 11 month old grand-daughter. She loved watching Disney. We will just stick to Sesame Street. I wouldn't recommend Disney Plus to my friends.\n",

       " 'review_text': [\"I love Disney Plus! There is an amazing variety of movies & shows. If I'm in the mood for a great memory I can watch a movie from my childhood. There are some that are so special to me. Including the original Parent Trap. Such great memories with that movie. Also, if there are movies I've missed out on I can watch those. For instance, I was not able to go to the theaters when the new Aladdin movie came out. It was awesome to get to watch it in the comfort of my home. Popped popcorn, had snacks. It was great, lol. Love the variety. It's nice to be able to view movies when I want and according to what I'm in the mood for. Thumbs up!\",\n",
       "  \"I love the idea of being able to stream all of Disney and its subsidiaries films whenever I want. I don't like that every company has to have a streaming platform but so Far Disney+ is at an affordable price and doesn't destroy my budget. However this service is constantly buffering and freezing at times so frequently I have to just give up. I would think that a company worth as much as Disney would have higher quality streaming. Aside from the lag I'm pretty happy with the service.\",\n",
       "  'I love Disney+. The variety is great, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, StarWars, and National Geographic. Incredible diversity. I figured that I would never use Nat Geo. Boy was I wrong. Incredible programming. I was looking for museums and found Cars/SOS. I am hooked on this series. It is in England but the restorations that they do in 3 weeks are phenomenal. Of course Star Wars is a favorite too, Mandalorian is fantastic if you are a Star Wars fan. The behind the scenes in the Disney is always interesting and informative. It’s a great streaming and I highly recommended it.',\n",
       "  'I think the Disney channel is awesome. It’s great for children as well as adults. It’s great to watch the Disney movies I grew up watching. Also my grandchildren love watching The Disney channel. It’s also very educational. Some of the kids shows on other channels should not be considered kid friendly. But did Disney will actually let you know if they are not. Especially the older ones. They were not considered offensive when made back in the day. But nowadays are considered offensive. I highly recommend The Disney channel. Disney always goes above and beyond.',\n",
       "  'Disney+ it’s good if you have young children or if you’d like to watch classic Disney films which I do, and we are a big Star Wars fan so that’s a plus. That’s the main reason why we got it. Also my son likes Marvel movies so we’ve already watched everything. Wish there was more to watch. I think I’ve seen 80% of what’s offered except for the National Geographic. The Disney Channel is not my genre, but my son used to watch this when he was little...',\n",
       "  \"While Disney Plus offers lots of access to their content they've produced over the ages (which is great), there is a new theme emerging that is troubling. Disney Plus is starting to introduce homosexual themed content intended for children to watch and have exposure to. I understand homosexuality is a complex social issue, but Disney should NOT be taking it upon themselves to expose and indoctrinate children to this kind of behavior via animation. For thousands of years, the traditional family has been the fundamental unit of society and teaching young children that these societal trends are ever changing only creates more questions and confusion, especially inside homes where traditional Judeo-Christian family values are taught.\",\n",
       "  \"I paid for a year of service, week 2 and I still can't watch a movie without an error code interrupting our movie. Customer service is horrid at resolving such issues, and blame my 100mb per sec isp. We haven't been able to watch anything without it buffering, till it error codes out.\",\n",
       "  'I prepaid for 3 years for Disney+. I later added the Hulu and ESPN+ bundle that was supposed to add $6/month to my bill (per their advertising). After my free Verizon period ended my bill went up $3.07. When I was talking to the online representative I had to ask for a supervisor multiple times. They would not honor the prepaid period, and said that they would take my prepayment and spread it over the 3 years. When I finally got the supervisor on the chat he was not helpful at all either. The content on Disney+ is ok, but when you compare to other providers, and having several service providers available, we can’t pay for them all (nor do we need them). The under $4/month was reasonable, but the way they handled my account was not. Check your bills.',\n",
       "  'I purchased subscription and noticed limited movie selections. I attempted to cancel subscription online and was not able to. Received notice that cost would be increasing also. I called customer service and states not able to cancel due to purchase through Roku however there are no active subscriptions. Disney Plus states not able to help period.',\n",
       "  \"As everyone is aware, Disney Plus increased their rate starting February 23rd. I subscribed on February 22nd around 6:30pm, my account wasn't billed until 00:33am the 23rd (6 hours later) so they could charge me the new higher rate. Business ethics would dictate that I could sign up at 11:59pm on the 22nd and still get the old rate. Not with these guys. I opened a request online and was told someone would email me and I would get a survey to fill out regarding how my request was handled. No contact from Disney. Very disappointed that a company with a family reputation like Disney would purposely cheat me out of money and then ignore me.\",\n",
       "  'Tonight I called Disney Plus and talked to a rep named Shaquiah in North Carolina. After a frustrating 35 minutes on the phone with her she told me that Disney Plus doesn\\'t seem to be compatible with my smart TV. I find that very surprising and don\\'t believe that my 4K LG smart TV is unable to download the Disney Plus app. I already have Netflix and some other apps downloaded, but when I typed in Disney Plus the app didn\\'t populate. My keyboard menu on the TV doesn\\'t have the actual \"+\" sign. She said without that symbol I can\\'t download Disney Plus. Other info she gave me seemed very suspicious as well. She told me that Disney Plus doesn\\'t have and has never offered a 7-day free trial. However, right on their website they mention a 7-day free trial. She also said the price per month in Cdn. dollars has always been $8.99, even though a co-worker said he had Disney Plus 4 months ago for $6.99 (and the rate is listed as $6.99 on their website).',\n",
       "  \"My daughter rec'd a subscription for Disney Plus streaming from her Aunt on her birthday. When we tried setting it up on her smart tv, it wouldn't take the codes sent by email. My sister is in S.C. We are in Ca.. Called for help, was hung up on 4 times after 10+ min holds each time! Finally get a rep, spend over 30 min on the phone trying to resolve. He then contacts tech support! I thought I already had tech support, that's who I called! They advise him to tell me to run a systems speed test with IT directions.\",\n",
       "  'I have never been able to receive surround sound with Disney Plus, even though I can with every other streaming service. After calling in month after month with their technical support saying they were aware of the issue and it is not yet resolved, they awarded a free month to me and said they would contact me with a resolution. Today, 9 months later, I called in to ask why my subscription was automatically being renewed and I was told that the free month was never awarded and I would not get it. I asked why nobody contacted me like they said they would and they said they closed the file months ago without informing me. Terrible tech support, terrible customer service and a rude and abrupt telephone representative. What a terrible experience in every way with your streaming service. Do not expect anything added to what they already have on their service. Netflix is 1000% better.',\n",
       "  'Purchased 3 years of service. It was put in hold because Verizon offered a free year. Then Verizon offered it included it in their service for good. Called to request refund, approved but never got it.',\n",
       "  'We have had a Disney Plus subscription for six months. When Mulan came out, we were anxious to watch it. We were on the DisneyPlus site where we paid $29.99 using the account information and credit card on file in order to watch Mulan. The Disneyplus offer was that we would be able to watch Mulan more than once. We have gone back to the DisneyPlus site to rewatch it and have been unable to unless we again pay $29.99. I finally called DisneyPlus customer support. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 13 minutes. They are unable to do anything to help. They agree that they have our money, (I produced our credit card statement) but they said I would need to contact Roku and ask for a refund and then start over. This should be between Disney and Roku. It is not our issue. I am very disappointed that DisneyPlus refuse to correct this.',\n",
       "  'Disney Plus offers a bundle with HULU and ESPN. I was double billed and the wait time is over 40 minutes on any given day. I ended up having to \"chat\" with an agent who was not useful at all. HULU was the same, no personal service, no accountability. As a business owner, you are only as good as your customer service team. I ended up canceling the so-called bundle. I have an 11 month old grand-daughter. She loved watching Disney. We will just stick to Sesame Street. I wouldn\\'t recommend Disney Plus to my friends.',\n",
       "  'I love Disney+. My 5 year old loves it. I love it because of the content and not worrying about what he may or may not see. He loves it because he feels the channel only applies to him and was made for him and he can pause/replay or stop at anytime. The movies are great!',\n",
       "  \"Quality is great, many 4k movies. Almost all Disney movies on it plus Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar. Since launch they didn't seem to add much new content, not at the rate of other streaming services. I get it is cheaper than others, but I just wish for more newer original content. Really great for kids.\",\n",
       "  \"The selection of videos and series is sufficient and tends to increase within a 1-3 month period adding new content. However, I've had multiple issues where Disney error message occurs during playback. This ends up with completely logging out and back in or watching program at a later time.\",\n",
       "  'Great for families with kids! And I personally got it being a Star Wars fan, and wanted to see the Mandolorian. Just wish there was more content- Same for Nat Geo- Great programming, but short of content.',\n",
       "  \"Disney + hits the nail on the head when it comes to shows and movies that you remember from childhood. I love that about it. What I dislike is when I'm watching a show like Mandalorian it buffers a lot. Which makes it take forever to watch. I don't have a problem like that with the other services.\",\n",
       "  \"It is so nice to be able to watch such a wide variety of Disney tv and movies. The first thing I watched when I tried the service was a childhood favorite and I was hooked. I've since noticed I use Disney+ much more than any other streaming service that I've been subscribed to. The UI for the player could use a little work, but otherwise, I'm really happy with Disney+ and what it has to offer.\",\n",
       "  'I ordered this for kids at home, knowing it would offer appropriate entertainment for their interests. To my delight and surprise there are many shows and movies that I have enjoyed and look forward to watching soon. I am so glad to have this service. I only used Netflix for a couple of years, being frugal. This is well worth spending extra for and I will keep using it indefinitely!',\n",
       "  'I really thought Disney+ was going to be for the kids. Truth be told, I watch it more than the kids do. The content variety is excellent. Are there Disney movies? Yes. And Star Wars. And The Avengers movies. And great series (been watching Primal Survivor, which is outstanding). Quite frankly, I think they underpromised and overdelivered.',\n",
       "  \"At its current offering it is a great service. A lot of content that satisfies everyone at any age. Always something to watch and a nice diversion from the current events. Let's hope that Disney doesn't get greedy and keeps the price affordable.\",\n",
       "  'Disney has one of the better streaming services out. The app works much better than some other apps like CBS which has constant delays. I would like to see a little more original content created for adults but otherwise I’m extremely satisfied with it.',\n",
       "  'I really like having all the Disney movies and shows available immediately to me and my family. Very easy to navigate and search the app. Or use it on a Samsung TV and it works great with the remote that came with the TV so I didn’t have to add an extra remote. Also my living-year-old daughter loves her TV shows.',\n",
       "  'The interface is clean and easy to use. I feel comfortable watching any show from either a streaming device or an app on my TV. I love the fact that I have HD and UHD options for streaming. Sign up was easy without any lengthy forms to complete. I feel the price is just right for the amount of content received.',\n",
       "  'This streaming service doesn’t just include those adorable titles you think of when you hear the word Disney, there is so much more! I have been able to watch movies from my own childhood along with my kid’s latest and greatest films. We are all caught up thanks to Disney+.',\n",
       "  'It’s basically perfect, has all of the greatest movies from the past. Also has all of the new ones that have recently launched. The streaming itself never lags and is always fully HD unless a movie from the past. Overall an streaming service!',\n",
       "  \"I love Disney Plus. My kids and grandchildren get the shows or movies they want to see, and I can catch up on the Star Wars saga or Avengers. It's a great service for multiple age groups in one home. We can find something appropriate for all of us.\",\n",
       "  \"Disney+ has been pretty good. The variety isn't as good as with Netflix but they do have a number of things we really like. We have had quite a few problems with streaming where the picture freezes. We've never had that problem with Netflix so it can be really frustrating.\",\n",
       "  'Things aren’t A to Z. Hard to find certain movies. Needs better description for some. Categories need less of a featured feel to it and more of a numerical timeline also more categories better organized.',\n",
       "  'Their behind the scenes content like Disney Imagineering is well worth it. Plus there’s endless options of things for my 5 year old to watch. Between Disney Junior and Marvel he’s a happy kid. I also get share some of the old classics with him as well, without tracking it all down at the library, like I was doing before.',\n",
       "  'I enjoy Disney+ because of all of the classics especially all of the Star Wars episodes. My son finally got to see the first three and he was amazed. Netflix has some really good series but the variety of movies are lacking in my opinion but overall both are priced fairly.',\n",
       "  \"For adults, if you love watching Disney movies that have been out for a while this a great service. If you're looking for new content not as much to offer. What they do have in new content is worth watching though. Of course, for kids it's fantastic.\",\n",
       "  'Disney Plus. What can I say? I only got it because of my kids. It was a nightmare to deal with customer service in the beginning. Astronomical wait times. The movies it has are ok in itself but I feel like Disney has a gazillion dollar’s time spend and the platform sucks. You can’t preview any movies. The titles are so small you have to actually click on a movie to see what it’s about. How is it that no one can fix that? Netflix platform is amazing! Anyway other than that I don’t really care much for it. Sorry.',\n",
       "  \"Great selection of movies for kids, only issue or complaint I have is if it's a Disney movie or franchise company of Disney then the movies should be available to watch regardless of any other contacts. And during covid pandemic it would be nice to have the movies that were set to release is July and December released for streaming. If you can early release Frozen 2 then you can early release the other movies.\",\n",
       "  'This is a streaming service that offers a variety of shows and original programming but, I feel as though I quickly run out of options for new content. The true advantage is access to the Disney library obviously. I just feel that at some point I will be reevaluating my subscription based upon the frequency that I access this streaming service and my interest level in their programming that is specific to this platform.',\n",
       "  \"I was a bit iffy on getting Disney+ to start because I already own practically every Disney cartoon, Star Wars movie and Marvel movie on DVD or Bluray. But not only is there a slew of old live action movies on Disney+ but also some great new content like the Mandalorian. It's definitely worth the $75 I paid for a year.\",\n",
       "  'Excellent service. I have issues trying to reproduce 5.1 DTS sound over my receiver. It may be because of my old Kenwood receiver but other services are capable of reproducing on 5.1 DTS without issues. Image quality is excellent and streaming is seamless.',\n",
       "  'Great service if you want to relive your past as a kid or watch one of the few new things they offer. It great to turn on for the kids as they love so many of the shows on here. Quality seem really solid and does not seem to degrade much at all.',\n",
       "  'Disney did not do a good job with this launch. Our tv is 6 years old and there’s nothing wrong with it but because it’s not new I can’t get the app for my kids which I find ridiculous. Even though that was 6 months ago and I was assured by staff that a version for older tvs was coming, that never happened.',\n",
       "  'Disney+ has been pretty amazing. My kids always find something to watch, and with a toddler that loves all the old Disney shorts, it makes it even better. Plus the old shows that my husband and I free up on are all there. No more looking on YouTube for stuff!',\n",
       "  \"I love Disney+. Finally all my favorite kids' movies and my kids' favorite movies in one app, great price and so far I haven't had any issues with the service, I love how it's not just Disney. There's other things also!\",\n",
       "  \"This is an exceptional site with a wide range of great entertainment delivered at an equally exceptional price. My grandchildren love the cartoons and shows such as Mickey's Clubhouse, and the whole family loves watching the movies. We highly recommend Disney+..\",\n",
       "  'I really enjoy the fact that there are cartoon shows available that I used to watch as a kid on Saturday mornings. The changing lineup also keeps things entertaining. Even though I receive this service for free courtesy of Verizon, I will for sure be a paid customer after the free period is over because they offer it at such a good price considering you can’t get most of the programs on any other platform.',\n",
       "  'Disney + is great for family viewing of Disney classics plus new series such as The Mandalorian. Good variety of content for all ages and remembers what your choices are so you don’t always have to go search what you want to continue to watch.',\n",
       "  \"Best launch and most reliable new service available. The price, the packaging with Hulu, the library and ease of use is amazing. My kids have a ton of options. And we do as well. The only challenge is that the release of new material so far can't compete with Netflix.\",\n",
       "  'I choose Disney because of how much kids love it. From the get-go it was able to compete with Netflix. Its also priced much lower than other competitors. It is definitely lacking in adult content but that is to be expected and again is reflected in the price. Video quality and load times are on par with other services.',\n",
       "  'Love every one of their categories. The traditional movies bring back nostalgic feelings from childhood. The Star Wars movies and programming are particular favorites. Marvel movies are all contemporary pleasures, And, the Pixar offerings are modern-day classics. National Geo will be my next exploration on Disney Plus.',\n",
       "  'The streaming service is fairly new. There were a few bumps in the road like, video playback errors. But they seem to have became less as we use the service. I would say all it needs is a better set of category organization on the home screen. We have to search things to find options and we missed out on so many movies because they weren’t advertised on the home screen.',\n",
       "  'It is a very easy service to use. It has 3 different services in one. Lots of options also. You get to watch the vintage vault. Lots of fun shows for everyone. Tons of star war things to watch. Then you can switch to Hulu to watch the latest shows. Also ESPN.',\n",
       "  'Disney Plus is our family’s favorite streaming service. They have a good selection of shows and movies for every age. Our kids love Disney Plus. We especially love Disney’s fun and educational shows. Thank you.',\n",
       "  \"I was so glad to have found this streaming service. It has all the classic movies from my childhood that I can now share with my children. It also has movies that adults can enjoy which is a great plus. The fee could be a little bit lower but as of right now I don't mind paying it for the selection of movies I'm getting.\"],\n",
