    - The project focuses on web scraping customer reviews for Disney's streaming service. In addition,
      I also webscraped the customer reviews for the two most populer streaming service such as Hulu and 
      Netflix. This is because Disney's streaming service is realtively new and only has a small amount of reviews. 
      Information from the customer reviews of three streaming service will be used to determine the amount of 
      which state has the highest amount of customers that have paid streaming services. Also, statistics such as 
      average income, internet access, household size, and teenage demographic will be obtained for each state.
