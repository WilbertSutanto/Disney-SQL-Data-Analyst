Hulu has been a reputable company so far! The one thing that I strongly recommend paying the additional even during the free trial (which they pro rate) so the few extra dollars are worth spending. If not the commercials will drive you crazy! That is one point I strongly urge anyone that’s looking into trying hulu!  Pay the extra money for commercial free or they might refer to it as ad free. I hope my review helps you in making a better decision whether hulu is right for you or not. \n",

Apparently a monthly fee (nearing $100/mo) is not sufficient enough for hulu to halt failing hulu engineering that tries to determine device location. They do this for advertising purposes, but hulu's algorithms fail location dramatically when faced with (what is typical for most homes) a dynamic IP connection to their internet provider.\n",

I am very strongly considering canceling my Hulu subscription and going back to my previous tv provider where I can record shows and fast forward through commercials.

If I call them I spend an hour waiting for someone to answer and another hour disconnecting my wifi and my Roku and hooking them back up and removing the app and reinstalling it. Even though Netflix, discovery plus, Peacock, Apple tv, paramount plus and Disney all work well. It seems to always be my equipment. So I paid the extra money and boosted my internet to 400 mbps and the third Roku that I've had Hulu on (This time I bought the most expensive one). That didn't help!

So anytime an NFL game runs OT, one does not get all of their program. For instance, on January 3, 2021, the NFL game on CBS ran OT. Meaning 60 Minutes started late, NCIS LA started late and NCIS NOLA started late. Streaming NCIS LA provides about 15 minutes of the end of 60 minutes, then the beginning of NCIS LA. To see the rest of NCIS LA, one must stream NCIS NOLA and after completing LA, one can then view the first 30 minutes of NOLA.\n",

      "review_text: When looking at the available plans, it states the amounts are all inclusive but subject to local sales taxes. Unfortunately, the amount charged after sales tax also ads any additional \"communications\" or any other taxes that are dreamed up. Now with the price increase effective in December of about 19% ($10 on my plan) I will now be paying about $2 shy of what I was paying for cable TV and lost the ability to change channels directly without having to go back to channel listings and scrolling through the list just to change channels. Hulu is much more inconvenient than cable and now with the price increase it's making it less and less worth \"cutting the cable cord\". It seems Hulu is a good way to wear-out a remote control and use more batteries.\n",

Just one year later, Hulu has decided to increase their monthly price to $64.99/month. It is now the same price as DirecTV. I will be cancelling my subscription with Hulu and making the switch over to DirecTV because it is much more convenient when you turn on the TV.\n",

However, Hulu ads are really becoming an issue on their live t.v. I have actually timed some of the shows I regularly watch. There is a very small portion we are talking 3-5 minutes of the actual show for every 4-6 minutes of ads. It is really extremely frustrating and I've seen others complain about the same issue. Hulu needs to scale back their excessive ads before they lose customers for good. It's just too many commercials for such little show viewing time allotted. Seriously commercials and ads are Overtaking the platform and the other issue is Hulu keeps raising their monthly prices. \n",

Okay, but many don't have commercials, especially with the cloud DVR. UNLESS you have a TV on Comcast - then, no fast forward ever. Plus, the Cloud DVR is a joke. No control over how many shows to keep, and each device has a separate recording queue as well as recordings! You can't watch shows recorded on another device.\n",

You can't skip commercials, you can't rewind during programs. It is just awful! And get this. You have to wait until the commercials are over to rewind to rewatch a 30 second clip before the commercials started. Then once you are done, you have to rewatch the commercials. It is so awful, I am tempted to go back to satellite TV.\n",

You will click on the movie you wish to watch and it will say, watch with Starz or Showtime or HBO, etc. and it will have a picture of a lock in the bottom corner.

We stream on Netflix and base Hulu a lot and have never had any issues streaming. After a lot of research we decided to try Hulu live. We like the convenience of being able to stream on any smart TV but not sure how long we will be staying with Hulu live. The two big issues are the feed crashes (on different TVs) and you can’t fast forward through commercials. Not being able to fast forward through commercials is a huge killer during sporting events. I can no longer use the bathroom or grab a bite and then come back and catch up to live TV. What really makes this unacceptable is when I am behind a few minutes and then it crashes I have to restart the service and miss part of the game.\n",

I wanted to cancel my service through them 5 days after they took the payment out and they wouldn't credit my account for even a partial refund. Their customer service sucks and also having the service I would always have to restart the TV at least 5 times a day because Hulu would always freeze up. Don't waste your time and energy on them!\n",

      "review_text: I haven't had cable in a few years but decided I'd give one of the live TV streaming packages a try and I settled on Hulu. My first observation was that many of the 70 touted channels were \"off air\" most of the time. All the others only stream in stereo, not surround. Additionally, any of the On Demand movies you have access to through the TV portion of the service are also only offered in stereo and many of the titles are \"formatted to fit your screen\" which means they've been cropped and/or edited so the network could make time for commercials. With all modern content being mixed in surround HULU is offering its customers a sub-par product. Who wants to watch Star Wars in stereo? They also only offer TV and movies from TV networks in 720p even if the network broadcasts 1080p via traditional cable. They may as well just offer TV in black and white. I have now cancelled my subscription until they start caring about modernizing their technology.\n",

Today January 22nd I found out instead of canceling my account Hulu went into my bank account, took money that was not there and cause the overdraft fee. I was told by my bank hulu is using deceptive practices by using the same approval code you get when you sign up for hulu free month trial which means if you have overdraft protection on your account Hulu can override any overdraft protection at any Bank because of the code they get when you up for the free trial. Hulu failed to tell you that. \n",

Just over a month ago, I noticed all my conservative shows (like Fox New Network,  Outdoor Man, etc) keep getting removed from my record / watch list every few days and they don't always have the current day episode available to watch. (But will have last day or two.) I go back and put the shows back on my list, only to have them removed again in 2 or 3 days! Now I see why --- THEY APPARENTLY SUPPORT LIBERAL DEMOCRATS (ie: their new special about Hillary Clinton coming out soon.) And are trying to control what their customers watch!!\n",

Hulu by itself is $9.99, but that's just for the content they have rights to and only for one person, one device. Step that up to multiple devices and that comes to $14.99. Want ANY of the good movies? HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and Starz will bring that monthly total to $59.99. If you're Hispanic, just for being hispanic, add $5. Not kidding.\n",

The user interface is clumsy at best, but tolerable. However, I discovered that they were getting sneaky with their billing practices. They raised my monthly fee in December 2019 by $10 with no advance notice via e-mail. So, I downgraded to their basic $5.99 package. However, it keeps trying to get you to upgrade to their Live TV package on-screen. Even though we say \"No\", it still upgraded us, again with no e-mail confirmation or anything. The only reason I noticed it is because PayPal notified me. There is no way to stop this one-click solicitation and billing trick, and so if you have kids, be careful. \n",

I realize you can purchase a “no ads” version but that’s only on the streaming library side not the Live TV side. You literally watch maybe a 40 minute show and there are 7-8 sets of around 240 seconds of ads. So frustrating. I will be considering something else because of this.\n",

      "review_text: Hulu customer service is the worst. First, representatives usually cannot fix problems or lack knowledge about issue. For example, Hulu is guilty of making updates at inconvenient times assuming patrons are not watching. When called out about programs being unavailable, representatives can't respond adequately nor share when program will be available. Perfect example wished to watch SNL (Saturday Night Live) on Sunday, Nov.17th. The latest episode aired Saturday, Nov 16th. At 5:00 p.m. the latest episode was still unavailable. To add insult to injury don't call to make a complaint because you will be on hold until forever only to have call answered by a representative who cannot answer the simplest questions.\n",

      "review_text: I actually used to love Hulu. I've personally converted quite a few people over to it to get away from the arbitrary billing of Comcast. Well, it seems Comcast has been busy teaching Hulu the fine art of price gouging and not caring about their customers. According to the email just sent out today, there is an impending price increase of an additional $10 per month, to take effect next month. I personally gave them no less than five new subscribes in the past two weeks. This is my reward. According to the Deadline article dated today... “Price changes are never easy to stomach, and we know that many people don’t watch live television year-round, so we’ve made it easy for Hulu subscribers to switch back and forth between our plans to best suit their needs,” it said. Greed is the bottom line here. So long, Hulu.\n",

However, I travel for a living and was SO excited to see the addition of liveTV to their line up! Now I would be able to continue watching my shows live when on the road. However, within 3 days of using liveTV on \"unlimited\" devices (paid extra for this as well) it became apparent that they may have an issue with truth in advertising. Yes, I can utilize liveTV while traveling but am only allowed to do that 4 times a year - well, that is also not quite true. You see, they limit your \"unlimited\" ability to just one IP address. If you travel you can change your location 4 times a year, but included in those 4 times is the change back to your actual home location. So essentially you are just limited to traveling with their service twice a year. \n",

First, it has nothing to do with my bandwidth/speed as other programs and internet was readily available. HULU even put up a screen that said their engineers were aware of the problem and working to resolve it, please watch something else. What I learned today was, (1) the network providing the game to HULU, can apparently cut the signal to HULU for whatever reason, including (and I know this is lame, especially at halftime), lack of ticket sales. (2) HULU itself might have a more localized game deemed more important starting. I’m sure HULU knows this in advance but you won’t find it stated anywhere.\n",

So, I asked them to send back my Walmart gift card since Hulu and I could not use the gift card. She told me she could not do this. Her answer was for me to use the credit with their Hulu $5.99 plan. I do not need this, so I wanted money back. Is there anyone who can help me get the $50 back. Hulu can not use the credit either because I do not have a Hulu account. The money will just sit in their account, which is not fair to me. I will not recommend Hulu to anyone???? Please help me. Thanks, Barbara\n",

But Hulu's technology is pathetic. Constant buffering. With over 100 Mbps I have plenty of internet speed. When I experience buffering I run internet speed checks. Internet speed and latency are never the problems. The latest problem is frequent failure to load live TV followed by a message that says \"We're working on it...\" Hulu's technology is pathetic. But the technology to charge my credit card each month works just fine. I was hanging on because I found one of their original series fascinating. But the technology is so unreliable that is no longer enough. Time to switch to YouTube!\n",

I decided to test out Hulu yesterday and paid for a subscription, but immediately when I first went to watch any videos, and even one I tried to load today, there were so many ads. I had to turn my ad-blocker on because I had toggled it off before that, but for a paid subscription, they still showed ads. I know they're considered commercials, but the fact that my ad-blocker skipped through them for me implies they still give enough information to the ad-blocker to know how to skip through it...aka block it.\n",

Accessing the channel list or guide is not intuitive and far away from being user-friendly. The number of clicking required to get to the viewing mode is unnecessary. The worst feature or lack there of, is the inability to skip commercials during playback. This is just not for me. I cancelled the service before the week's trial.

The person we talked to was very nice but said that due to some contractual obligations some shows would have advertising. I am not going along with this entirely. When we upgraded to the 55 or so per month plan there was advertising and we accepted that. The ads would show at random times for maybe 30 seconds or less. Now it is 4 minutes at a time. Maybe this is due to Disney taking over but at any rate we will keep an eye out for another service that has less advertising. All I can say is try before you purchase.\n",

Didn’t cross my mind because with everything if there is a payment problem I would get an email saying payment issue and I would just update my payment method.

So I wonder is that the reason I didn’t receive a email. Now the only way I can resubscribe is at a higher rate which I was planning to do once my Black Friday promotion ran out.

BUT IT DID. $15/month for almost two years for DVR space and ZILCH to show. I'll never get Hulu again. And unfortunately, it was the only that had the lineup and channels I prefer. Too bad. Their explanation of why I can't get a full refund of the DVR payments is that I had too much activity on my account. In other words, because I watched Hulu almost every day, something I paid for too, they couldn't refund what I had also paid for but don't have anymore.\n",

I know this because every year or so, I decide to give them another chance at providing streaming video where I can watch a show or movie without the hiccups. Every other time a commercial shows up, the video you're watching back tracks. This happens on our smart TV and our streaming box. Sometimes, the video goes back 15-20 minutes, forcing you to navigate back to where you were. Other times, it resets to the start, and occasionally, it throws off the audio/video sync making the video unwatchable. That's the technical part. \n",

When selecting the category desired, a list of what's on at the current time is displayed, in alphabetical order.

Hulu gives you 4 home changes which wouldn't be an issue if you run on a business static IP however its home IP's are not typically static. Which means your IP address can change even though it's the same house same TV. Hulu then wants you to update your home location. 3 power outages in roughly an 18 month period basically made this service completely useless. When you are out of home locations you no longer can use the live feature and support can do nothing to rectify the problem. They recently raised the price of the service raising it well over the Sling combo (which is likely the route we are going now). The unlimited TVs does not fix the home issue so don't bother with that unless you have a ton of people watching separate TVs always.\n",

      "review_text: We're trying to extract AT&T from our lives. DirecTV must go after serving us since 1988. AT&T RUINED them. We signed up for Hulu Live + Enhanced DVR + No commercials... Every option available. Here's a list of concerns that we've been, thus far, unable to resolve. We pay an additional $15 for the privilege of forwarding through DVR'd commercials. We also pay an additional fee for unlimited screens. We also pay an additional fee for no ads - and here's the best part... There are STILL ads. I'd say Hulu nickels and dimes us, but the fact is it's not nickels and dimes, it's $15s every time you turn around. Unacceptable. As if the Fast Forward fee wasn't enough, using our Apple TV, we are unable to fast forward with scrub/preview so that we can see WHEN the commercial is over. Hulu simply pauses the screen while the clock advances. No solution. Premium price. Unacceptable. \n",

      "review_text: I cut the cable in Aug 2018 and switched to Hulu Live TV. Even with paying the cost for the \"more than 2 TV's in the household option,\" I was pleased with the amount of money I was saving compared to cable. I was happy with the channel selection and always had good, clear pictures with little to no buffering. In Dec. 2018 I noticed that I was experiencing some buffering (although signal and strength of wifi is excellent), but I could deal. (I also have a brand new Roku). Then in Jan. 2019 and ever since, I have frequent buffering and distorted pictures that are constantly breaking up. NBC is by far the worst. ABC has a good picture but the words and mouth do not match, even after going out and reloading Hulu and re-booting the Roku. \n",

      "review_text: HULU was the first streaming I signed up with. I was always very pleased until lately. Hulu restricts the screens you can watch on. We have 4 TV's in my house and even though I am paying this every month we can't watch on more than 1 screen/tv. This should not be happening as long as it is the same household. I can't watch a show in the living room while my kids watch another show in the bedroom. I was excited when I found out the option existed for multiple screens but of course that is only if you buy Hulu live. It's no longer worth it. Bye Hulu, hello Netflix and Android box, it's a sad day when good customers get the shaft. I have spoken with customer service to no avail so I gave up.\n",

I called to find out what was going on. The lady I spoke with gave me 4 refunds of 7.99 well 2 days later I had only 3 of my refunds. So it's been Past the 3 to 5 business days. Had already called they said they will fix it after 5days. So I call today and they said they already refunded it they will not do it again. So they had been taking my money but won't give back what they took. They gave me tracking numbers to give to my bank and transaction numbers and reference number. I have had my bank run these numbers and they cannot find it no where. So Hulu still will not give me back my money and clearly you can see I only got the 3 was suppose to be so I am just out my money. It's not a lot but it's mine and I want it back. What can I do next?\n",

      "review_text: I have had Hulu for quite some time, the better part of Three years. I would say things were going great, well up until their latest updated for the PC. This update changed all my favorites into a mystuff folder and well---- it is incomplete. The new GUI look is bleaugh. Looks more like the web page than an app... I have to actually type and search for stuff. All the change in the interface is just cumbersome...well to me. When you click on a show it instantly wants to play instead of giving you all the seasons and or episodes. Takes a bit of navigation to get to specific episode you want. Where in the old app you would click your show and it would take you to the latest episode and have the previous episodes right below it, kind of cool if you wanted to re-watch previous episodes. I liked the old app. It was easy, quick and no frills. The new app is about to make me cancel my subscription.\n",

A digital antenna gives you the same thing without pause and record every month for less than two months of additional service cost. I like the shows available and with no commercials I pay about $15/ month. Bundled with other services like Netflix and Amazon Prime it is far cheaper and better than cable or satellite TV.\n",

      "review_text: Hulu is the best at bringing Network ABC/CBS programing and their original programing is good. I do believe the interface and program tracking algorithm could be refined, as sometimes it is unclear without scrolling through screens as to what is new when you are following multiple shows. I use a Roku Ultra. Other than that, it meets my needs when it comes to the shows we like to watch. The content is expanding, however not at the rate other service are. All in all it is a great service and I do not plan on dropping it. It is a great alternative to network/cable TV. Keep up the good work!\n",

      "review_text: I like the service. I like the program options. The issues with this service for me are the commercials and frequency of commercials. They are the same commercials 5 times in a row per show and the amount of commercial breaks for a 40-45 minute show is the same as watching it live. In summary, you watch just as many commercials as live TV, and the extra downsides are you will walk away hating the company that advertises and you're paying for the commercials. I don't try to keep up with Live TV so I'm not bothered like some of the other complaints about the ending of the \"next day airing\" of popular shows trying to leverage to pay for the live tv Hulu subscription.\n",

Obviously if you are watching a show live with Hulu live there are going to be ads, realistically how could there not be ads. I am not swayed by the poor reviews because by researching any product, you know what you are getting. Paying around $50 a month is much cheaper than what cable or DirecTV charge!

It hasn’t even been a year that I’m with them and they’re already raising the rates. The entire point of switching to Hulu was to save $ but they seem to be going in the same direction as the larger companies. I called and spoke to a “supervisor” named Kenya whom sounded like she was 18 years old and had no customer service skills at all. She basically said the reason for the price change was because they’ve added a lot of channels over the years. Ummm, all those channels were already there when I signed up. She couldn’t help me and basically said it’s my choice if I want to switch. Hulu is becoming a scam! Searching around for alternative options right away.\n",

Keep in mind that when you sign up for commercial free with Hulu; very few shows are commercial free and DVR shows you have to fast forward through them. If you don't have cable then Hulu is an excellent service. \n",

The customer service guy was very rude and disrespectful and told my mother where a woman's place should be!! She asked to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor told her the same thing and hung up on her. Companies like these let foreigners run their customer service with no regard to the customer. Nothing will happen to them at all... They can talk to you as they wish because what is one disappointed customer when they have millions. The disrespect of my mother angers me, but I know nothing will be done. I will cancel my service with them for sure!!\n",

What I don't like is that they offer, for an additional charge, no ads (commercials) yet they still show commercials. I hate commercials so of course I opted for this additional service. Well, I'm finding that this is not the case. I am getting tons of commercials when watching shows. So I live chat a customer service rep. to find out what is going on. First he tells me that the \"no ads\" is for their streaming library only. Yes, of course... I know they can't cut the commercials from live TV. So I explain that I am watching something from the streaming library. Then he tells me that oh well \"some\" networks still add commercials anyway. \n",

I started to binge watch one of my favorite old TV shows \"Roswell\" which had 3 seasons. Their idea of \"limited commercials\" is a joke. There is a commercial before the show starts, at least 4 during the show and one before the end credits. That's 6 commercials in one 44 minute show. Each commercial break has an average of 5 advertisements. This is ridiculous. If the price had been more I would have cancelled immediately. I would never pay full price for this junk. Luckily there is a new streaming channel on my Roku that has Roswell (Dust). They have not finished loading all 3 seasons yet but have assured me (via email) that all will be loaded by the Christmas holidays. I'm going to wait and watch it there (they had no commercials).\n",

However, after the trial period Hulu will switch your Live channels to a different city and claim that it's due to your Internet Provider's address. The problem with this is that what they have switched me to does not even have ABC as a channel option and about 1/2 of the channels that I had during the trial period. Why would I pay for Live TV if I cannot have all of the major channels?

My kids have a few shows on Hulu so let them deal with the unable to load & commercials. My kids hate Hulu but like their shows. My favorite is when we hear them yell at the TV when their show is at the end and it stops and disconnect. They have to start the movie or show over and fast forward to the last few minutes... Netflix, Amazon and Vudu don't disconnect like Hulu... My wife and I stick with the others. We will discontinue Hulu after this month. There's a reason they have a horrible rating.

Loved the TV series offerings, lots of recent content, no over-hyped \"made for Hulu\" movies. Started way back when the service was free. Decided to cut the cable and got the full boat Hulu Live subscription. Horrible experience. Incessant login issues, error messages when loading episodes. It's unbearable. I'm done. Cancelling and moving on.\n",

I have always found the content to be varying and can usually watch all of my favorite shows next day on the app or website. Recently with the new update things have gotten annoyingly complicated. In the \"Keep Watching\" section of the site my shows do not update to reflect the newest episode, and there is not a way to get to the new episode from there. Instead I now have to search for the show and then click episodes to get the new updated episode. I cannot remove shows as easily from my \"keep watching\" list as I did before. \n",

Content: When I began using Hulu, it had a very limited content selection. However, over the past few years, Hulu's acquisition of NBC content along with their seemingly turn-taking with Netflix shared content, the base of available (and desirable) programming has greatly expanded. Recently, they have done a very good job at providing both original programming, live features, and desirable delivery of current content that has lent for a higher quality of customer satisfaction. \n",

I paid with my debit card for September 2018, then my bank statement showed I'd been charged twice. I contacted Hulu, the cs agent apologized and said she'd authorize a refund. She also said she'd authorize a free month, no payment due in October 2018. So I was really happy with arrangement. But now it's 3 weeks later, no refund and my account with Hulu says my next payment is due September 29, 2018. And I've not gotten my refund either. I just chatted with another cs agent, he said problem with refund is Roku's fault, he also wouldn't even address the free month issue, he just acted like I'd never mentioned it, even after I referred to it a third time! So now,I'm done. I'll try Sling TV, it's same cost as Hulu with live tv. Only more channels.\n",

      "review_text: I signed up for Hulu to watch at my new Smart TV. I was offered one month free with subsequent months to be charged to my credit card. I provided all required info including cc number online at my computer. However, that wasn't enough for them. Went to my Smart TV to watch a program and could not view without once more adding same info via the TV. I then canceled the service and when I did so, was advised I could view until 06/05, thus completing the free intro month. However, when I tried to view at TV, locked out. I expected to have more movie variety available as I have no need to view TV programs. Disappointing offerings which prompted my cancellation. Went to Hulu chat, and agent claimed I had initiated immediate cancel, which I had not. This was use of deceptive tactic. I insisted all my data including cc number be expunged. I do hope it was. Don't waste your time or $$ on Hulu.\n",

I have a 120 Mbps cable internet service, more than 10 times the bandwidth recommended by Hulu and yet I constantly experience the same problems voiced by so many others on here... programming 'stuttering' (repeating itself multiple times), gaps (part of this stream missing), etc. Heck, even 'my channels' appear and disappear from the menu. I don't know what the issue is, whether they've seen an increase in subscribers and haven't increased the infrastructure to support it but I am going back to my research and will soon be cutting the Hulu cable too.\n",

I have used Hulu in various places with different internet providers on phones, tablets, Blu ray player, laptop, game console, etc. And no matter place or device, I rarely am able to watch more than one episode of any show because it takes so much longer to play. A 38 min episode will take at least 47 min to play because of buffering. Also, even though you pay a monthly fee you still have to wait for commercials on top of all the buffering.

Years ago when I was working 18 hour days sometimes 7 day weeks (only 10 hours on weekends) I'd signed up for a 2 week trial. I never used it, not once. When they offered a 30 day trial, my life had changed dramatically and I was heading for SSDI & much older. I asked to use the then-current promotion via Groupon (?) and Hulu flat out refused. They offered a 1 wk. trial. It takes me a week to decide which day I will go grocery shopping... I practically begged them to allow me to test them and see, using the 30 day promo (I knew I'd join) but they refused. Thus, I took advantage of Amazon Prime Fire TV, bought the stick, 2 years later took advantage of Prime's 1 mo. free Netflix promo and am now a member of Netflix.

If not the commercials will drive you crazy! That is one point I strongly urge anyone that’s looking into trying hulu!  Pay the extra money for commercial free or they might refer to it as ad free.

Even though Netflix, discovery plus, Peacock, Apple tv, paramount plus and Disney all work well. It seems to always be my equipment. So I paid the extra money and boosted my internet to 400 mbps and the third Roku that I've had Hulu on (This time I bought the most expensive one). That didn't help!

I downloaded the channel and it doesn't even recognize me and wanted me to create an account.

So anytime an NFL game runs OT, one does not get all of their program. For instance, on January 3, 2021, the NFL game on CBS ran OT. Meaning 60 Minutes started late, NCIS LA started late and NCIS NOLA started late. Streaming NCIS LA provides about 15 minutes of the end of 60 minutes, then the beginning of NCIS LA. To see the rest of NCIS LA, one must stream NCIS NOLA and after completing LA, one can then view the first 30 minutes of NOLA.\n",

Therefore, if you have to reboot your router or if the internet goes down, when it comes back on it gives you a new IP address. Hulu Live only allows your home location to be switched 4 times. If you have frequent internet outages (which windstream often does), well there goes your 4 home location switches. When I called hulu to asked why my location kept changing, the first thing I was asked, \"do you by chance have Windstream as your internet provider?\" It is great when it works, but very frustrating that we were not made aware that it could be an issue.

      "review_text: Hulu.com offers a Black Friday Deal every year during Thanksgiving weekend. The offer is available to anyone who has not had an active subscription for the past 3 months. The payment went through at the regular charge. After chatting with Hulu chat support for over an hour, they have refunded the charge and closed my account. Since the account was reactivated, I am no longer eligible for the Black Friday Offer. There are other customers who have had inactive accounts who are also being charged at the regular rate and are being denied the Hulu 2020 Black Friday Deal.

BUT, as soon as you sign up, go through everything they have, they have not once had a single show they advertised they have on their site. It is false advertising, it wastes people's time for no other reason than \"bait and switch\" tactics to get you to join. They really should be investigated for it. Personally, do not waste your time, they really don't have a great selection for the prices, and NEVER seem to have a show they advertise they have.\n",

      "review_text: We've been subscribers to Hulu's live TV streaming service for three or four years now. At first, it was great. Our price started (I believe) at $39.99 a month, which was a great deal. That price has since gone up each year, with two $10 increases in the last two years, bringing the price up to $64.99 a month. This is depsire a lack of new content being added. In fact, FOX regional sports networks were recently, which means we can't watch local MLB games anymore. The service also disconnects several times a day, and repeated chats with customer service have brought us no closer to a solution. They don't try very hard to keep you as a customer either. \n",

Unfortunately, the amount charged after sales tax also ads any additional \"communications\" or any other taxes that are dreamed up. Now with the price increase effective in December of about 19% ($10 on my plan) I will now be paying about $2 shy of what I was paying for cable TV and lost the ability to change channels directly without having to go back to channel listings and scrolling through the list just to change channels. Hulu is much more inconvenient than cable and now with the price increase it's making it less and less worth \"cutting the cable cord\". It seems Hulu is a good way to wear-out a remote control and use more batteries.\n",

However, Hulu ads are really becoming an issue on their live t.v. I have actually timed some of the shows I regularly watch. There is a very small portion we are talking 3-5 minutes of the actual show for every 4-6 minutes of ads. It is really extremely frustrating and I've seen others complain about the same issue. Hulu needs to scale back their excessive ads before they lose customers for good. It's just too many commercials for such little show viewing time allotted. Seriously commercials and ads are Overtaking the platform and the other issue is Hulu keeps raising their monthly prices. \n",

Okay, but many don't have commercials, especially with the cloud DVR. UNLESS you have a TV on Comcast - then, no fast forward ever. Plus, the Cloud DVR is a joke. No control over how many shows to keep, and each device has a separate recording queue as well as recordings! You can't watch shows recorded on another device.\n",

You have to wait until the commercials are over to rewind to rewatch a 30 second clip before the commercials started. Then once you are done, you have to rewatch the commercials.

We like the convenience of being able to stream on any smart TV but not sure how long we will be staying with Hulu live. The two big issues are the feed crashes (on different TVs) and you can’t fast forward through commercials. Not being able to fast forward through commercials is a huge killer during sporting events. I can no longer use the bathroom or grab a bite and then come back and catch up to live TV.

The original series and movies are usually my favorite. The added HBO and FX has added to the value of the subscription. The shows are readily available instead of having to wait weeks or days with my local cable company.\n",

First...when I go to resume watching, it not only goes BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT EPISODE I WAS IN, IT MIGHT GO TO THE ONE BEFORE. Consequently I end up watching stuff over and over as I don't see a way to bypass an episode. Second..selecting a different episode from a series is not intuitive. As best I figure, you go to Search, select a series, then episodes. So why add anything to my stuff??? It doesn't mean anything. Will add other comments to new complaints so they are noticed.\n",

Flip a channel you will get about three minutes of commercials first, then flip back to first channel you were watching, you will get another three minutes of commercials. Great content, terrible platform! Hulu reminds me of the old Windows 3.1. It also crashed all the time. We also have Netflix and Amazon Prime for many years. They NEVER have crashed.\n",

I explained their system didn't warn me at the time I signed up but to no avail. The rep had no desire to acknowledge my side of the story because \"he'd not heard this complaint before\". Pleeease!!

      "review_text: I haven't had cable in a few years but decided I'd give one of the live TV streaming packages a try and I settled on Hulu. My first observation was that many of the 70 touted channels were \"off air\" most of the time. All the others only stream in stereo, not surround. Additionally, any of the On Demand movies you have access to through the TV portion of the service are also only offered in stereo and many of the titles are \"formatted to fit your screen\" which means they've been cropped and/or edited so the network could make time for commercials. With all modern content being mixed in surround HULU is offering its customers a sub-par product. Who wants to watch Star Wars in stereo? They also only offer TV and movies from TV networks in 720p even if the network broadcasts 1080p via traditional cable. They may as well just offer TV in black and white. I have now cancelled my subscription until they start caring about modernizing their technology.\n",

I was told by my bank hulu is using deceptive practices by using the same approval code you get when you sign up for hulu free month trial which means if you have overdraft protection on your account Hulu can override any overdraft protection at any Bank because of the code they get when you up for the free trial. Hulu failed to tell you that. \n",

Hulu by itself is $9.99, but that's just for the content they have rights to and only for one person, one device. Step that up to multiple devices and that comes to $14.99. Want ANY of the good movies? HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and Starz will bring that monthly total to $59.99. If you're Hispanic, just for being hispanic, add $5. Not kidding.\n",

They raised my monthly fee in December 2019 by $10 with no advance notice via e-mail. So, I downgraded to their basic $5.99 package. However, it keeps trying to get you to upgrade to their Live TV package on-screen. Even though we say \"No\", it still upgraded us, again with no e-mail confirmation or anything. The only reason I noticed it is because PayPal notified me. There is no way to stop this one-click solicitation and billing trick, and so if you have kids, be careful. \n",

For example, Hulu is guilty of making updates at inconvenient times assuming patrons are not watching. When called out about programs being unavailable, representatives can't respond adequately nor share when program will be available. Perfect example wished to watch SNL (Saturday Night Live) on Sunday, Nov.17th. The latest episode aired Saturday, Nov 16th. At 5:00 p.m. the latest episode was still unavailable. To add insult to injury don't call to make a complaint because you will be on hold until forever only to have call answered by a representative who cannot answer the simplest questions.\n",

Well, it seems Comcast has been busy teaching Hulu the fine art of price gouging and not caring about their customers. According to the email just sent out today, there is an impending price increase of an additional $10 per month, to take effect next month. I personally gave them no less than five new subscribes in the past two weeks. This is my reward. According to the Deadline article dated today... “Price changes are never easy to stomach, and we know that many people don’t watch live television year-round, so we’ve made it easy for Hulu subscribers to switch back and forth between our plans to best suit their needs,” it said. Greed is the bottom line here. So long, Hulu.\n",

However, I travel for a living and was SO excited to see the addition of liveTV to their line up! Now I would be able to continue watching my shows live when on the road. However, within 3 days of using liveTV on \"unlimited\" devices (paid extra for this as well) it became apparent that they may have an issue with truth in advertising. Yes, I can utilize liveTV while traveling but am only allowed to do that 4 times a year - well, that is also not quite true. You see, they limit your \"unlimited\" ability to just one IP address. If you travel you can change your location 4 times a year, but included in those 4 times is the change back to your actual home location. So essentially you are just limited to traveling with their service twice a year. \n",

Here are my experiences: Late start, missed first parts of the game, can't go back and find that, recorded only part of the game, switched during the middle of the game to some other game's halftime show, couldn't go back and pick up my game in \"live\" mode, had to start back three minutes into the first quarter, could not forward to live, missed about 30 minutes of the game trying to figure out how to go back to where I was, then it only recorded half the game so I couldn't even go back and watch it after it was over.\n",

      "review_text: Updated on 10/05/2019: I’m following up to my previous post after talking with HULU support about missing the second half of football games. First, it has nothing to do with my bandwidth/speed as other programs and internet was readily available. HULU even put up a screen that said their engineers were aware of the problem and working to resolve it, please watch something else. What I learned today was, (1) the network providing the game to HULU, can apparently cut the signal to HULU for whatever reason, including (and I know this is lame, especially at halftime), lack of ticket sales. (2) HULU itself might have a more localized game deemed more important starting. I’m sure HULU knows this in advance but you won’t find it stated anywhere.\n",

The next day, I was unable to log into Hulu using the same username and same password. I tried to communicate with their customer service, but you have to do that through \"your account\", which I could not access. There is no telephone number you can call for customer service, which is a clue as to their idea of customer service. After several tries, I finally replied to one of their emails to cancel my account. Oddly, afterward, I was able to log into my account, where I saw a bill for $63.97 for \"add-ons\". While I was in my account, I cancelled again. After reading about the experience of other subscribers, I will monitor this very closely. I have not checked their BBB ratings, but I imagine it is similar to their ratings on this site.\n",

Internet speed and latency are never the problems. The latest problem is frequent failure to load live TV followed by a message that says \"We're working on it...\" Hulu's technology is pathetic.

I had to turn my ad-blocker on because I had toggled it off before that, but for a paid subscription, they still showed ads.

Now that we upgraded to Live we can only use it on our phones and Xbox and in home computer. No longer can we log in on our smart TV's or work computers. So either I have to change our TV types or change our streaming choice because I'm paying for something so limited. I am guessing they didn't think this all the way through! Everyone in my home shouldn't have to hold their phone to watch Hulu now with the exception of my son because Hulu can no longer tell if we aren't sharing our log in information.

Accessing the channel list or guide is not intuitive and far away from being user-friendly. The number of clicking required to get to the viewing mode is unnecessary.

      "review_text: Got Hulu solely for the LiveTV feature. Came from PS Vue, which has its own problems, thinking that Hulu was better. Sadly it's not. When it's working, the service is fine for the few live TV channels we watch, with only occasional audio sync problems. However, since they put the price up we have been having far more problems. Just plain doesn't work sometimes - tried reinstalling the app etc. but nothing. Using it via Firestick. Unfortunately have come to the conclusion that there really is no worthwhile streaming live TV option right now - none of the players have a good enough service and their charges are steadily increasing making cable look competitive again. Then again, the cable guys do control the pipe into your house.... Hmmmm?\n",

Every other time a commercial shows up, the video you're watching back tracks. This happens on our smart TV and our streaming box. Sometimes, the video goes back 15-20 minutes, forcing you to navigate back to where you were.

When selecting the category desired, a list of what's on at the current time is displayed, in alphabetical order.

Hulu gives you 4 home changes which wouldn't be an issue if you run on a business static IP however its home IP's are not typically static. Which means your IP address can change even though it's the same house same TV. Hulu then wants you to update your home location. 3 power outages in roughly an 18 month period basically made this service completely useless. When you are out of home locations you no longer can use the live feature and support can do nothing to rectify the problem. They recently raised the price of the service raising it well over the Sling combo (which is likely the route we are going now). The unlimited TVs does not fix the home issue so don't bother with that unless you have a ton of people watching separate TVs always.\n",

      "review_text: I had YouTube TV - never had any issues but it was not available on Fire TV so I gave Hulu a shot. I have yet to see the end of a game since switching Hulu cuts the end of every game I've watched. I have a gig of internet speed but Hulu buffers all the time then jumps to less than 480i then it goes back after a min or 2. That on its own is a deal killer but missing the end of every game is the deal killer. I'm surprised Hulu can charge so much for such crappy service.\n",

Every option available. Here's a list of concerns that we've been, thus far, unable to resolve. We pay an additional $15 for the privilege of forwarding through DVR'd commercials. We also pay an additional fee for unlimited screens. We also pay an additional fee for no ads - and here's the best part... There are STILL ads. I'd say Hulu nickels and dimes us, but the fact is it's not nickels and dimes, it's $15s every time you turn around. Unacceptable. As if the Fast Forward fee wasn't enough, using our Apple TV, we are unable to fast forward with scrub/preview so that we can see WHEN the commercial is over. Hulu simply pauses the screen while the clock advances. No solution. Premium price. Unacceptable. \n",

I was happy with the channel selection and always had good, clear pictures with little to no buffering. In Dec. 2018 I noticed that I was experiencing some buffering (although signal and strength of wifi is excellent), but I could deal. (I also have a brand new Roku). Then in Jan. 2019 and ever since, I have frequent buffering and distorted pictures that are constantly breaking up. NBC is by far the worst. ABC has a good picture but the words and mouth do not match, even after going out and reloading Hulu and re-booting the Roku. \n",

We have 4 TV's in my house and even though I am paying this every month we can't watch on more than 1 screen/tv. This should not be happening as long as it is the same household. I can't watch a show in the living room while my kids watch another show in the bedroom. I was excited when I found out the option existed for multiple screens but of course that is only if you buy Hulu live. It's no longer worth it. Bye Hulu, hello Netflix and Android box, it's a sad day when good customers get the shaft. I have spoken with customer service to no avail so I gave up.\n",

I have had my bank run these numbers and they cannot find it no where.

I have to actually type and search for stuff. All the change in the interface is just cumbersome...well to me. When you click on a show it instantly wants to play instead of giving you all the seasons and or episodes. Takes a bit of navigation to get to specific episode you want. Where in the old app you would click your show and it would take you to the latest episode and have the previous episodes right below it, kind of cool if you wanted to re-watch previous episodes. I liked the old app. It was easy, quick and no frills. The new app is about to make me cancel my subscription.\n",

I think it would be fair that there would be an option for upgrading with at least a discounted rate for the commercial free version through Sprint. Hulu carries pretty much all scripted show that are currently on TV except for CBS shows. It would be nice to be able to get all of the shows in the same place rather than have to subscribe to CBS All Access too.\n",

They are the same commercials 5 times in a row per show and the amount of commercial breaks for a 40-45 minute show is the same as watching it live. In summary, you watch just as many commercials as live TV, and the extra downsides are you will walk away hating the company that advertises and you're paying for the commercials. I don't try to keep up with Live TV so I'm not bothered like some of the other complaints about the ending of the \"next day airing\" of popular shows trying to leverage to pay for the live tv Hulu subscription.\n",

Obviously if you are watching a show live with Hulu live there are going to be ads, realistically how could there not be ads.

The entire point of switching to Hulu was to save $ but they seem to be going in the same direction as the larger companies. I called and spoke to a “supervisor” named Kenya whom sounded like she was 18 years old and had no customer service skills at all. She basically said the reason for the price change was because they’ve added a lot of channels over the years. Ummm, all those channels were already there when I signed up. She couldn’t help me and basically said it’s my choice if I want to switch. Hulu is becoming a scam! Searching around for alternative options right away.\n",

They somehow got money out of my account and they re-activate the account without letting me know about it. Only I had Hulu for the entire month of December without even being notified or even authorizing it. The bank charged me $35 for overdraft fees. Hulu says they’re not responsible for the $35. Bank told me that they would not be a $35 charge if Hulu didn’t take money out of the account. As of right now I do not have Hulu or Huntington Federal Bank!\n",

      "review_text: My situation is unique that I receive Xfinity with my HOA but I did not want cords all over my house. So I chose Hulu with most of the bells and whistles for $64 per month. It served it's purpose because most channel apps did not link with Xfinity. Two years later Xfinity has its own app and most channel with their independent app do link now. So Hulu is no longer cost effective for my home. Keep in mind that when you sign up for commercial free with Hulu; very few shows are commercial free and DVR shows you have to fast forward through them. If you don't have cable then Hulu is an excellent service. \n",

Well, I'm finding that this is not the case. I am getting tons of commercials when watching shows. So I live chat a customer service rep. to find out what is going on. First he tells me that the \"no ads\" is for their streaming library only. Yes, of course... I know they can't cut the commercials from live TV. So I explain that I am watching something from the streaming library. Then he tells me that oh well \"some\" networks still add commercials anyway. \n",

I started to binge watch one of my favorite old TV shows \"Roswell\" which had 3 seasons. Their idea of \"limited commercials\" is a joke. There is a commercial before the show starts, at least 4 during the show and one before the end credits. That's 6 commercials in one 44 minute show. Each commercial break has an average of 5 advertisements. This is ridiculous. If the price had been more I would have cancelled immediately. I would never pay full price for this junk. Luckily there is a new streaming channel on my Roku that has Roswell (Dust). They have not finished loading all 3 seasons yet but have assured me (via email) that all will be loaded by the Christmas holidays. I'm going to wait and watch it there (they had no commercials).\n",

However, after the trial period Hulu will switch your Live channels to a different city and claim that it's due to your Internet Provider's address. The problem with this is that what they have switched me to does not even have ABC as a channel option and about 1/2 of the channels that I had during the trial period. Why would I pay for Live TV if I cannot have all of the major channels?

My kids have a few shows on Hulu so let them deal with the unable to load & commercials. My kids hate Hulu but like their shows. My favorite is when we hear them yell at the TV when their show is at the end and it stops and disconnect. They have to start the movie or show over and fast forward to the last few minutes... Netflix, Amazon and Vudu don't disconnect like Hulu... My wife and I stick with the others. We will discontinue Hulu after this month. There's a reason they have a horrible rating.

Received an email for a free trial to come back because they missed me in 2016; I decided to give it a try. I was charged the next day. I contacted Hulu and was told I was not eligible even though I received an email. I had to forward the email to receive the free week- really Hulu? They sent out the email and are so greedy that they can’t even give a free week to allow someone to see if the service has improved. I got a free week finally after some back and forth and flash forward to 10/21 where I decided to try out Hulu Live. In my account, I upgraded and it said that I would have a week free. \n",

      "review_text: About two years ago I was somehow signed up for Hulu. When I caught it I canceled it over the phone with one of their agents. Today as I was balancing a checking account I realized I had been missing the fact $7.99 has been continuously taken even after cancellation. When I called, yet again, I was told by the agent I was speaking with her supervisor could not take the phone. They could only refund 3 month?? I was asked to call back later and maybe could help further. I understand Hulu has a new CEO. I wonder what his thoughts are on his own company robbing people like this??? Thank you for allowing this warning. The agent I thank you, your supervisor RUDE!!\n",

I have always found the content to be varying and can usually watch all of my favorite shows next day on the app or website. Recently with the new update things have gotten annoyingly complicated. In the \"Keep Watching\" section of the site my shows do not update to reflect the newest episode, and there is not a way to get to the new episode from there. Instead I now have to search for the show and then click episodes to get the new updated episode. I cannot remove shows as easily from my \"keep watching\" list as I did before. \n",

Content: When I began using Hulu, it had a very limited content selection.

Recently, they have done a very good job at providing both original programming, live features, and desirable delivery of current content that has lent for a higher quality of customer satisfaction. \n",

I paid with my debit card for September 2018, then my bank statement showed I'd been charged twice. I contacted Hulu, the cs agent apologized and said she'd authorize a refund. She also said she'd authorize a free month, no payment due in October 2018. So I was really happy with arrangement. But now it's 3 weeks later, no refund and my account with Hulu says my next payment is due September 29, 2018. And I've not gotten my refund either. I just chatted with another cs agent, he said problem with refund is Roku's fault, he also wouldn't even address the free month issue, he just acted like I'd never mentioned it, even after I referred to it a third time! So now,I'm done. I'll try Sling TV, it's same cost as Hulu with live tv. Only more channels.\n",

I work in advertising so I’m surprised by this concealment of having a 2017 or later model requirement, which is not disclosed. Very disappointing. Also, mobile user interface for Live TV seems awkward.\n",

      "review_text: I consistently had trouble with the interface and its lack of intuitiveness. What used to be one click to go from one station to another on cable turned into a five minute clickfest. Performance was okay, but flaky internet (at times) meant we couldn't watch TV. Our current cable bill for TV, phone and medium speed internet is $220 a month. Our TV is a 2016 Samsung and it did not support Hulu Live, so I had to buy a Roku (or the like) to be compatible with my 4K TV, cost $100. So disregarding that cost, the $40 per month would save me $60 a month and be very inconvenient. \n",

Went to my Smart TV to watch a program and could not view without once more adding same info via the TV. I then canceled the service and when I did so, was advised I could view until 06/05, thus completing the free intro month. However, when I tried to view at TV, locked out. I expected to have more movie variety available as I have no need to view TV programs. Disappointing offerings which prompted my cancellation. Went to Hulu chat, and agent claimed I had initiated immediate cancel, which I had not. This was use of deceptive tactic. I insisted all my data including cc number be expunged. I do hope it was.

I practically begged them to allow me to test them and see, using the 30 day promo (I knew I'd join) but they refused.

Hulu has been a reputable company so far! The one thing that I strongly recommend paying the additional even during the free trial (which they pro rate) so the few extra dollars are worth spending. If not the commercials will drive you crazy! That is one point I strongly urge anyone that’s looking into trying hulu!  Pay the extra money for commercial free or they might refer to it as ad free. I hope my review helps you in making a better decision whether hulu is right for you or not. ',\n",
       "  \"Because I had only heard non-complimentary things about Hulu. But Hulu was the only one that had a particular series I really liked, so I tried it myself. I had only intended to take the free trial, and then drop it. But now it's just about the only one I watch. I was so pleased to see the series that I watched when I had cable, and so many new ones that I enjoy. I would give them 5 stars if I could! Great big THUMBS UP!!!\",\n",

Despite the fact we are paying for unlimited use for any device, I cannot travel away from my home location for more than thirty days otherwise the service is discontinued. Very Frustrating indeed. If I am paying for the subscription and the device is registered on that account I should be able to travel to any location for the length of my stay and not have to deal with that.',\n",
       "  \"When I first started streaming I was set up with Sling, which I wasn't impressed with especially when I switched to Hulu. I couldn't believe the difference. I made the switch thanks to a neighbor who was willing to split the cost of the service & the internet with me, which by the way I have to throw in HUGE KUDOS for CenturyLink even though that's not what we're reviewing but back to hulu, the cost itself for live hulu was cheaper than sling, even without splitting the bills & the HUGE variety of channels, movies & on demand can't even compare. \",\n",
       "  \"I like Hulu because you get access to network TV shows as soon as they air. However, their movies and propriety TV shows are lacking. Honestly the one shows I watch on Hulu are from NBC and Food Network. If they didn't have that, I would cancel. I also think it's so weird how they are the streaming company to have different pricing for ads. And the price difference is only a few dollars less. It should be free if you have to watch ads.\",\n",

I had to eventually close down my charge card to prevent them from charging month after month, even though I cancelled service. Beware - this is a scam.\",\n",
       "  'Our Hulu entertainment was like breathing air. It was sustaining and carefree. This continued marginally after adding \"live TV\". Apparently a monthly fee (nearing $100/mo) is not sufficient enough for hulu to halt failing hulu engineering that tries to determine device location. They do this for advertising purposes, but hulu\\'s algorithms fail location dramatically when faced with (what is typical for most homes) a dynamic IP connection to their internet provider.',\n",

I understand having ads on shows that are only accessible with Hulu Live, but I just spent a total of 21 minutes and 30 seconds watching ADS for a show that is 41 minutes long.... that is RIDICULOUS! I am very strongly considering canceling my Hulu subscription and going back to my previous tv provider where I can record shows and fast forward through commercials. Or at the very least, spend less time watching commercials for a show that is supposed to only be 1 hour long (41 minutes with ads would have left a total of 19 minutes worth of ad time, still outrageous, but less outrageous than what I just experienced).',\n",

After watching a show on the dvr it kicks me completely out of Hulu. Sometimes live T.V. doesn't even exist! If I call them I spend an hour waiting for someone to answer and another hour disconnecting my wifi and my Roku and hooking them back up and removing the app and reinstalling it. Even though Netflix, discovery plus, Peacock, Apple tv, paramount plus and Disney all work well. It seems to always be my equipment. So I paid the extra money and boosted my internet to 400 mbps and the third Roku that I've had Hulu on (This time I bought the most expensive one). That didn't help! I then hooked it direct with a lan line. Nope it didn't help! It has also been on three different wifi routers, You guessed it this has not fixed the problem! \",\n",

I canceled it and they went into my bank account and took money after being cancel and their service don't work. I would not recommend Hulu to nobody. If you do good luck getting it. Cancel now. I have to go to the bank to stop them from taking my money.\",\n",

Just discovering the billings I immediately checked my Roku TV because I know I haven't been watching Hulu and in fact didn't even have the channel downloaded on my TV. I downloaded the channel and it doesn't even recognize me and wanted me to create an account. I finally found the subscription buried deep within Roku - called and spoke to Hulu and was told, despite the fact that they can easily confirm that I have not been using the channel AT ALL they would not refund my money. Very unhappy with this company and will NEVER use them ever again. What should have been an over $90 refund is only 2 months - completely unacceptable.\",\n",

I have to restart Hulu each time this happens. This is very upsetting when watching live tv because I miss parts of the program. In ONE year, my subscription has almost doubled from $39.99 to $69.99.

They record programs based on TV schedules, not the program actual viewing time. This impact viewing a program just a few hours after air time. So anytime an NFL game runs OT, one does not get all of their program. For instance, on January 3, 2021, the NFL game on CBS ran OT. Meaning 60 Minutes started late, NCIS LA started late and NCIS NOLA started late. Streaming NCIS LA provides about 15 minutes of the end of 60 minutes, then the beginning of NCIS LA. To see the rest of NCIS LA, one must stream NCIS NOLA and after completing LA, one can then view the first 30 minutes of NOLA.',\n",

Hulu should warn customers of this when people are signing up. Windstream has floating IP addresses. Therefore, if you have to reboot your router or if the internet goes down, when it comes back on it gives you a new IP address. Hulu Live only allows your home location to be switched 4 times. If you have frequent internet outages (which windstream often does), well there goes your 4 home location switches. When I called hulu to asked why my location kept changing, the first thing I was asked, \"do you by chance have Windstream as your internet provider?\" It is great when it works, but very frustrating that we were not made aware that it could be an issue.

Zero ads, yet I still get ads watching Travel channel and HLN. When I called customer service I was then informed that there are exclusions. Neither Travel or HLN are on the exclusion list.

That price has since gone up each year, with two $10 increases in the last two years, bringing the price up to $64.99 a month. This is depsire a lack of new content being added. In fact, FOX regional sports networks were recently, which means we can't watch local MLB games anymore.

It is really extremely frustrating and I've seen others complain about the same issue. Hulu needs to scale back their excessive ads before they lose customers for good.

You can\\'t skip commercials, you can\\'t rewind during programs. It is just awful! And get this.

You will click on the movie you wish to watch and it will say, watch with Starz or Showtime or HBO, etc. and it will have a picture of a lock in the bottom corner.

I spend more time fiddling with the controller and trying to get Hulu to respond (once a movie starts, forget trying to stop it, and nevermind trying to watch a series and go from episode to episode without intervention of 15 minutes).

I asked to use the then-current promotion via Groupon (?) and Hulu flat out refused. They offered a 1 wk. trial. It takes me a week to decide which day I will go grocery shopping... I practically begged them to allow me to test them and see, using the 30 day promo (I knew I'd join) but they refused.
