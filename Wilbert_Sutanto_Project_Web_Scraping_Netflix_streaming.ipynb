You can binge watch series that you may have wanted to watch but didn't want to watch from season 4. Just start it at season 1 and go. Don't have to be at home, you just take it with you. Sit outside by your pool and still watch your favorite movie. Netflix is up on new movies. Adding new ones everyday. They also show you what you might be interested in by what you watch. A big variety of new movies and series as well as old ones you might have forgotten. Need to take advantage of Netflix versus cable or satellite TV.\n",

Also on Hulu, if you stop the program you are watching, you have to start over again and find the place where you ended. Very poor. I also am currently on Prime through a promo. I have not been impressed with Prime. But that may be my inability to travel around the Prime conglomerate.

Degrading humiliating treatment from what they sadly consider customer service (and so called manager David and Ruben customer service). Billed me twice a month for over a year. On 2 separate occasions. The first time last year a wonderful lady in customer service helped me. She kindly resolved this the first time. (Not fully but she was so nice that was ok). So now again they started to double charge me again???\n",

No type of credit for days of it not working, I have the biggest package they have and I don't know why I even pay them 5 a month much less the 17. Then when you call to get fix they blame all others and talk to you like you stupid. They need better training. They then said they don't have troubleshooting department, I said, \"Well there is the problem,\" I then started to tell her how much it would help to have it then guess what? She was now the troubleshooting department, really lol. Now just trying to get me to shut up 2 hours on phone and I still have to keep unplugging ** and restarting it. Horrible customer service.\n",

NetFlix now has boring shows and movies, shows and movies that aren't relevant to me, are nothing that I like, and it just keeps getting worse. Quality programs have been replaced by fodder and garbage. And most all of the new content they get is nothing but Bollywood junk! I've sent them suggestions for years, obviously falling on deaf ears. They just don't care. Another company that's gone megalomaniacal with power and greed. They don't care about their customers.

Some do, but the vast majority does not. However, Netflix has been making their own \"made for Netflix' movies and they are actually very good! Not ones you have seen before at the movie theater or on tv. Still I would like to have a service that would show some of the current movies being shown without having to purchase them on pay per view. Overall, still satisfied with Netflix.\n",

      "review_text: I have subscribed Netflix two weeks ago and after two weeks, Netflix, without giving notice, cancelled my subscription. When I signed in when I was in another country, it asked me to renew my subscription - but with the fees of that country which is much higher than my original subscription fee. When I contacted the customer service, they said they cannot give the details but they suspected fraud and they cancelled my subscription. But, they said, I can renew my subscription. First, if you suspected fraud, why you are now allowing me to resubscribe? Second, why you do not contact me in advance and I find it out myself after some days? Third, why do I have to subscribe paying much higher fees? Should I suspect a case of fraud myself instead of Netflix?\n",

      "review_text: Just like Mike in Louisville, I have been a long time Netflix 3-at-home DVD service customer. But in the last 2 months, it seems all my in-queue, released to the public DVDs (now over 20 at this writing) show either a \"short wait\" or \"long wait\". So I sit waiting for many days with no DVD despite turning around their sent DVDs quickly. When I called to complain they say that the problem is \"high demand\" to which I countered that the real problem is \"low supply\". So my account (and Mike's) are obviously very profitable for Netflix because I pay full price and get 20% of what I pay for. With the $17.23/month I now pay Netflix, I can buy 3 streaming services each month that I now do not have. Sadly, I believe the corporate strategy for Netflix is to discourage the DVD service subscribers so they can eventually eliminate mailing DVDs and move everyone to the much more profitable streaming service. Once again, corporate greed wins the day.\n",

      "review_text: A few months ago I found out Netflix was charging my mother's bank and credit cards twice a month. I thought it was something that she did because she is always messing up her checking account since her stroke a couple of years ago. I fixed everything and then today I found that they were charging MY bank twice a month also. I called them and they couldn't explain yet again why I had 2 accounts and why I have been charged for 3 moths in a row. When I told them to credit me back and fix it they stated they could only credit one this month and that I would have to call my bank and dispute the charges for December and January. They are ripping people off and the sad part is I have been paying for something I don't even have time to use. I only signed up so my mom could watch at home. I cancelled my account with netflix completely and I would suggest all of you check your bank or credit card statements to see if they are screwing you too.\n",

Then he said, \"Well it should be refunded back to your card within 48hours so sorry about that.\" It's been 3 weeks total now, I spoke again with another manager who claim he doesn't see the charge and in the entire company of Netflix, there is no manager there name Chris!! Long story short I was billed twice and I can't get my money back and canceled my service this morning after speaking with an outsourced buffoon who also told I can't get a refund.\n",

For years Netflix DVD worked great, however that is no longer the case & I'm about to cancel the service. I have trouble getting any DVD's now. I always keep 20 to 35 movies in my Netflix Queue. For about one year nearly all of these movies are listed as \"Short or Very Long Wait\". Even though I have their best plan (3 DVD's at a time) Netflix is \"Throttling\" my movie shipments. Netflix is showing nearly all of my movies as some type of wait in order to lower my movie shipments, thus making my account more profitable for them.

The scene where the monkey keeps play “in the jungle” and Ross, Chandler and Joey start dancing. Ya that scene is gone and so many more. Watching Jack** 3 they cut out the part where Bam super glues his hand to Dunn’s beard and when Bam uses the solution to clean the glue off his hands and burns himself. That’s also gone. This should not be allowed.. We as customers pay to watch out our favourite shows and movies in full. Not to have stuff cut out for no reason.\n",

It wasn't even 1 frig--ng min they had charged to my account the $12.99! I demanded it back before the end of the day and they totally ignored me. If I had known that I wouldn't have ordered it as I only keep so much in my checking and never take out money from my savings. I am telling you this is NOT a good company, they have no good business ethics! Beware of this company. I had the similar incident the last time I was with them. At 76+ I should have learned my lesson the first time. :) They say you're never too old to learn. :) I am now filing a complaint with the FTC and another complaint with the BBB. It is a pain to have to do this at my age but I must, I'm a 100% Disabled Veteran and I need to do it for my comrades also.\n",

No proper notice or reaching out to inform me. I was ok with the 15.99 at first because I can recognize that with all their original series and things offered still seemed fair.

I'm a big fan of horror movies and we constantly see the same selections that have been there for months before a new one becomes available. So basically they charge more and I get less. Not happy.\n",

We noticed that Netflix continued charging the credit card we only use for Netflix. There was much back and forth after we contacted Netflix, but we were finally told that someone in another country was using our credit card for Netflix. We immediately cancelled the credit card account. For security reasons, that card was only used for Netflix billing. Because this card was exclusive to Netflix and no other charges occurred before or after, we were confident that Netflix had been hacked.\n",

Most of the shows in English, you know, the language of this country, are old or just added seasons from current shows. A user can no longer write a review on their site, I believe since 2018, because it caused their subscriptions to drop. That tells me something!!

      "review_text: I was a past user of Netflix but discontinued the service well over a year ago. Recently I have been receiving emails asking me to \"Enjoy another free trial\". I thought I would give them a try since the email specifically said, \"Enjoy another free trial\" right on a button that linked to Netflix. They recognized my old account in in about 2 minutes I was up and running. Then I checked the billing area just to make sure it was free and it's then I determined I was being billed. I called Netflix and they said since I had once had a free trial, that I was no longer eligible. I told them the email said, \"Enjoy another free trial\" and they said read the fine print. Sure enough, the fine print said no additional free trials although in bold print the email sent to me which was from my previous registration said, \"Enjoy another free trial\". Chat with Netflix resulted in the same outcome.\n",

      "review_text: I have only one account. Netflix has been charging both my bank account and credit card account to the tune of $15 a month. $30 a month for Netflix. When providing my debit card which was not authorized, to customer service they refused to tell me who was using my debit card for Netflix. This is pretty much illegal to charge someone unauthorized then refuse to give the person in which the money was stolen from the information. They are working like a corrupt 3rd world government. This needs some serious investigation as they steal money then act like I'm in the wrong for asking them who is stealing my money? Criminals.\n",

      "review_text: Noticed when reading some reviews people are not aware physical renting legally anyone owns a physical product can rent it. If you buy it at store legally you can rent it out. Online streaming, the streaming company has to license the rights from the content owning company to stream it on an ongoing basis (meaning paying them forever else forfeiting the right to keep showing it). That's why if you do the physical disks via Netflix or anywhere you can get anything but the online streaming you can't find anything and have to find whichever service paid large outlay to solo license for multiple years a specific piece of content. \n",

Netflix no longer puts the flag of the U.S.A. When you pick your country of origin under the menu, the flag that is there is the N.W.O. or One world leadership.

I had to pay for almost a year for the account, then I cancelled. Then again it happened (probably from another user), then I cancelled, then again it happened!!! I contacted Netflix, AND THEY REFUSED TO REFUND THIS PERIOD!!! Shame on a big company like Netflix to steal money in this way.\n",

      "review_text: The biggest problem with Netflix service is that each movie has its license and expire date. Lately I've seen movies, and shows I love go, replaced by cheap, American productions. I don't say all of them are bad, but the most is just time-killer, even, though Netflix service is not for free. That's sad like, the positions on Netflix library are given us based on their popularity or price of the license and that's pointless to look for underground movies, less popular or just the older ones. Love Netflix, but still it's not a nice thing when for example \"Cloud Atlas\" is being replaced by \"The Perfect Date\".\n",

I had a manager tell me that no matter what the situation... they don’t do refunds & there’s no need to further discuss the issue.\n",

However, that didn't stop the Netflix representative I spoke to from blaming me for being careless with my card (even though, as I pointed out to her, it hasn't been used for anything else, so it's clearly not identity theft).

      "review_text: I was a customer of this service for years. I never had a problem returning DVDs, typically showing returned within a few days. The new release DVDs weren't usually available until a few weeks after being publicly released so I found I didn't use the service as much as I wanted so decided to cancel. I followed all directions and requested no further DVDs be sent. Netflix noted they sent a DVD after cancel, I listed this as never received and I returned my last DVD in time. Netflix has charged me for nonreturn of a DVD after canceling. After researching online this appears to be Netflix's standard business practice. Buyer beware, if canceling, clear your queue and return all DVDs where Netflix acknowledges receipt and then cancel so you are not charged for a \"nonreturned\" DVD. I was planning to activate streaming service, after this dishonest business practice Netflix will never receive another dime from me.\n",

Then when I go to my queue, I see that the top 6 are supposedly ready to ship. Either they lie or their system does not work as advertised. They should give up on DVD mailing and start streaming everything instead of just the stuff you don't want to see. The DVD service is frustrating and seems unfair or too random.

In general you get 2 movies A WEEK if you're lucky enough to have a fast delivery service. This costs a little more than $13 per month. My main issue is I have had SEVERAL scratched discs that wouldn't play through the entire movie or wouldn't play at all! I just received one that is cracked through the entire disc! That means yet another week to wait for a replacement! They clearly do not check their DVDs before they are sent out to the next customer. In all you get about 8 DVD rentals a month, one out of the 8 a month always comes damaged. For $13 you can go to a Redbox & get more than 8 movies a month. Don't waste your money.\n",

Turns out, in an instant not only had my account been hacked but a payment had been taken for a new subscription - in Colombian COP currency. Considering I already have a current Netflix account in my name/house address etc, and am based in the UK, surely the email change and location of currency should have aroused some suspicion at Netflix - or required a security question. Certainly shouldn't be doable in seconds. But no, the money has just been taken from my account. Security seems very poor.\n",

No more customer reviews really made me upset and no matter what I dislike those shows, and movies, are the first to show up. Their algorithm needs to be updated and it seems like they don't care. Original shows like 'Big Mouth' and 'Hilda' are spectacular but I don't think I'll keep renewing based off a few hits for the plethora of misses.\n",

      "review_text: Be aware Netflix will allow you to sign up for a Free Trial, and then charge you for the Free Trial if you have not been unsubscribed from their service for a year. The sign up went smoothly, and was only a few steps. The Supervisor actually stated that the system would have reflected being ineligible for the trial. It never reflected the information he stated it did. They also stated their system did not show the trial request being completed, although it was. Netflix also stated that everyone signs up the same way whether it is a Free Trial or not. Tried to set up again, to check for any information about being ineligible, and nothing states you are not eligible. Also was told that I had to call in seven days for a refund of the money I did not know I was being charged. Because I did not call in seven days the charge cannot be refunded according to their policy. Netflix is very interested in keeping their fee, and very uninterested in retaining a customer.\n",

These two \"titles\" are great chefs in their country, and they wanted a chance to get on Netflix, but Netflix put their people under their script.

I was getting a new error - \"Download Error. You have too many downloaded videos. Please delete a video and try again. (VC2-CV2-M1-B22005),\" when trying to download episodes of a tv show. I had been able to download 10 episodes 2 days before and today I couldn't get more than 3. \n",

      "review_text: My at home movie list was outdated. I had returned all my movies and they were still on the at home list for too long. I called to report it and my account was put on hold until an investigative team could get back to me in 72 hours. I had called to speed up the process which had stalled, and Netflix delayed it further as a response. This is the second time this has happened over a period of years. It happened a year or so ago when I reported a few movies not being removed promptly from the at home list after being returned. That time the rep threatened to close my account. Do not expect Netflix to be concerned with the impact of their incompetence, customer unfriendly policies, and poor quality of service. They retaliate. Given that they are largely a monopoly, this is very serious behavior.\n",

I have trouble going online, so I didn't. Contacted Netflix. They agreed I've been double-billed, but they will only refund 3 months.

However, they were able to identify my account and tell me this... and asked for my credit card information to verify my identity. None of this made any sense to me. I find it alarming in this day and age that an online subscription has live customer service available who cannot put a hold on account to protect a victim from fraud.

I called the Support of Netflix several times to fix this problem, because to me selecting films from a category list like Horror, Series, Thriller, etc is the most easiest and quickest way to get through the whole content. I mean the category option which shows up a good overview of about 15/20 films on the screen and in which you can scroll up and down in an easy way. In that interface, if you hit the return button, you can exit Netflix in a quick way. But it is this option they have removed from the interface.\n",

Why, you ask? For one, 90% of movies on Netflix are 'Netflix Originals'. 90% of Netflix originals are series. Why is that important other than the fact that it's very annoying and damn right wrong? Because Netflix doesn't pay royalties on their own ** content. There are very very very very few movies on Netflix that are worth watching. Most are very low budget and old AF... Speaking of, any movie found under the 'recently added to Netflix' list may just as well be a movie that was released in 1980. \n",

Netflix Jose told me the second account linked to my card showed the email was invalid. When I asked could he refund me the full amount from the second account that I have been charged for Netflix Jose said basically, “On our end it only lets us issue the last 3 months. You will need to contact your financial institution to dispute the rest of the charges.” When I told him it wasn't a good enough answer and Netflix are happy to take double payment and then shrug their shoulders when they are pulled up on it. \n",

I chat with a customer service and asked why. He/she said \"if you shared your account with someone, that person can re-activate my account\". Those that I shared with are small children. Not sure how they can reactivate the account! ==> This is just a BS way to explain why you continue to charge your customers after account cancelation. If I did not read my email then I will get charged every month without knowing!!! My conclusion is THIS IS CHEATING!\n",

      "review_text: So I've been watching/paying for Netflix since like 2012 and the one thing I've noticed is they've slowly removed all the best shows. I've been watching Doctor Who since I was a kid and they removed it off Netflix? Also when you're looking for a movie series (ex. Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean) They always seem to have the majority of the movies except for one that's like right in the middle or the first movie in the series.. WHICH IS INCREDIBLY ANNOYING. I also hate that they leave seasons out of a series. I just know Netflix is going to lose a lot of business if this is how they plan on running things. I've been really pissed off with how ** their service has been for like a year now. Ever since they made their prices went up they've been barely making any attempt to upgrade their service to match the price raise. Just incredibly disappointed.\n",

Netflix is a little later in the series as far as being current like Hulu but if you haven't watched a series from the beginning Netflix is a good place for that. Now my cons. Every so often Netflix does a price increase based on their reasoning of \"improving their services\". That being said with the movies or tv series there are moments quite frequent moments where it freezes continuously every two seconds. It gets so annoying to the point I have to unplug my device, wait, plug it back in and then try again. But oh no that doesn't work and it freezes again. So I ask you this Netflix, why all the increases if your product creates such an inconvenience?\n",

      "review_text: This hits primarily TV series and it gets painfully obvious after a while. You get Short wait, long wait or very long wait for disc #1 of a DVD season. What their system wants to say is that customers always want to watch the first disc of a TV season before getting the second disc. So let's say that you have a 5 disc TV season in your queue. That's 5 individual discs. Netflix tags disc #1 as long wait and none of the discs for the season are shipped. But if you change the sequence in your queue from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 you will get 2 - 5 pretty much immediately and disc #1 is left hanging as \"long wait\". If you want to give Netflix the benefit of a great doubt, you will have to believe that Netflix carries 1 copy of disc 1 and 50 copies of disc 2.\n",

      "review_text: Have enjoyed/loved Netflix DVDs for years, but in the last year there has been a noticeably great deterioration of service. DVDs aren’t sent out nearly as quickly, meaning that the # of DVDs per month makes my subscription more expensive. Probably that’s the point, eh. Plus, I can no longer see new DVDs right away, there are endless waits. Many DVDs in my queue have been there for long periods of time, even over two years! With such a significant deterioration in service, I fear that Netflix’ DVD service is going away completely—certainly they must be losing customers at a great rate. I’m so far sticking in, watching old stuff no one else wants to see, but if their service doesn’t improve, I’ll also have to go.\n",

I don't like it but everything is increasing anymore. Their Lack of new movies & shows (some takes up to 2 years or more after season is over to be available on Netflix.) I seen it on DVD and other sites before it reaches netflix. What is my biggest issues is the content that they're showing. A lot are no names that no one has heard of or Netflix made it. (**I have watched some I really liked & continued to watch) but my favorites are being removed mainly Fox shows that I noticed.

That is until you add up a year of paying for a service you thought you canceled.

      "review_text: Netflix is having technical difficulties which are interfering with my ability to use my account. I have spent hours on the phone with Netflix customer service agents & floor supervisors & everyone is telling me something different. One supervisor admitted there is a \"known issue affecting many customers\" but the agents and some other supervisors don't seem to know anything about it... or just won't admit it. I'm frustrated with all the hours on the phone trying to get this straightened out. Some calls are routed overseas. Some agents are rude & incompetent. They finally said only way to fix is cancel service and open new account. And now ANOTHER PRICE INCREASE! When I first signed up for Netflix years ago there weren't a lot of other options... now there are. Shopping around for better service!!! I see HULU is about the same price & has Seinfeld & tons of other good stuff!\n",

However, if it is something we don't like, it is very easy to stop watching and find something new and better. This programming certainly beats watching all the advertising of normal television. I know there has to be advertising but 8 to 9 spots in a normal half hour show is too much. Thank you.\n",

It made it impossible for me to browse to find what I wanted to watch next because it was so distracting and loud and every time I switched to a different show it started all over again. I called Netflix several times to get it to stop and they said there was nothing they could (or would) do to stop every show from automatically starting. It was so frustrating I cancelled my subscription. It seems like now that Netflix is so big they don't care about customer satisfaction anymore. I don't understand why they wouldn't offer an option to opt out of new things they are trying.\n",

Wait till you are mad to due to terrible experience and lack of care from Netflix. My business was not able to operate, I could go on and on...\n",

The CC (closed caption) speed is way, way too fast making it impossible to enjoy foreign movies. 2. I wish there was a better way to categorize the movies (Crime, Document, Children etc.) upfront. I hate the recently added, trending now, because you watched.\n",

Unfortunately with those, the number of episodes is very limited. They've left out a large portion of the series. They have some great documentaries, as well as interesting nature shows. I have only had a problem streaming once or twice and customer service was very responsive to that, quite quickly actually. I'm not happy about the price increases, but so far I have continued my subscription in spite of those simply because I would miss their programming if I canceled.\n",

For instance, I like the biography of Frank Lloyd Wright and could not get any of the movies on him. I love architecture, design and fashion and while there are a few, I cannot go in and order anything I would like. I wanted All the President's Men and could not get it on streaming... also, I have chosen movies that have captioning and when I turn it on, the captioning is not there. All in all, I do subscribe to it but kind of upset with it so I don't get to watch it as often as I would like to.\n",

Remember, Netflix offers original movies and some of the most original series in the recent years. However, Netflix is only as good as your internet service. The question is often asked as to how good is the streaming of Netflix? Well, if you have poor internet service do not be surprised if you do not get the quality you might have expected when using Redbox or a DVD. Perhaps, that is why Netflix has tipped their hat to Xfinity to provide a larger viewing area and spread the broadband. I will not be so shocked to hear that Netflix will be gobbled up by Xfinity in the next year since corporations will be corporations. Righty will be tighty. So let’s cross our T's and dot our I's because baby we ain't going like to pay for the next surprise!\n",

As for the price in this economy it should be at least $5.00 although the 9.00 about is not bad. There had been times in which I would have to cancel due to budget issues. They try and entice you by the free trial (which is very nice). They have disks that you can receive and charge more for that service which I understand. I have never had to call Netflix for any issues although I had been tempted when something I watched switched to only being available on disk only. Overall, not bad though.\n",

I also was never informed when they made you pay more to have blu ray. As a long standing customer, I should have been notified. I am paying a lot of money for POOR service. Anyone know of a new release movie company with comparable prices?\n",

I do enjoy an occasional foreign film, but the choices these days are ridiculous. The majority of the most recently added are subtitled. I'm finding myself watching more TubiTV, SnagFilms and Popcorn Flicks because the selections are mostly in English.

      "review_text: Parents be aware that Netflix is not following its own parental control matrix. I had a lengthy online chat exchange with a Netflix rep and was given the run-around with three different explanations as to why my Older Kids (max ratings TVPG) accounts were displaying programs rated TV14. Without giving you all the ridiculous details, the rep kept referring to the \"research team\" and it all boiled down to the fact that Netflix had either made errors entering the maturity rating for these shows or is intentionally steering younger audiences to more mature shows (Friends, which is basically a mature sitcom about sex, for example). BOTTOM LINE: Netflix parental controls do not function as advertised; they can't be trusted. PS The favoritism works in reverse too - some TVPG shows DON'T show up when they should as possible viewing choices for Older Kids even through the search function.\n",

Having received a $150 gift card at Christmas, I decided to open an account and become a regular user of the Netflix service. I attempted to watch movies, but for some odd reason, I could not connect to the service. After (3) days, I phoned Netflix's tech support for assistance. That turned out to be 2.50 hour call with no resolution. They tried to troubleshoot the problem but the final result was a verbal insult the agent didn't realize I could hear (when she thought the call was muted). That led to my request to cancel altogether. The worse part of this is that Netflix refused to refund the $150. They say their policy prevents them from refunding gift cards. I didn't ask for another gift card... I just wanted them to refund me the $150 VALUE of the card.\n",

My third disappointment was the removal of the customer review ratings. This may be the straw that causes me to switch to the triple play cable. One Big Disappointment.\n",

When the prices per month started going up, my parents decided to cancel. I still liked watching shows and movies there so I started my own account and paid for it myself. I've been doing that for a few years since I was in high school. I loved being able to watch the movies and shows they had because there were a lot of them. However, nearly every month my favorites are being removed from Netflix and replaced with crappy rated ones or originals. I like that Netflix is branching out and making their own brand, but only about half of them are actually decent. It's getting to a point where I can't find anything worth watching. And on top of that, I'm paying $9 a month and increasing. That is way too much to be paying for limited, bad titles. They need to figure it out because I'm this close to switching to Hulu.\n",

In the early days when they just had DVD rentals, I would have a long list of DVDs that I wanted and the order I wanted them sent. In that list there were always some that were indicated to be either having a short wait, long wait or extremely long wait. In the early days of my subscription when these wait items made it to the top of my list they would just go down to the next items and then send them.

Every movie I've attempted to search for could not be found and other proposed movies that were returned from my search seem lame or are in fact extremely lame and corny. I've gone through the list of offered movies and the majority of the listings are rated with ONE star. Also, I was less than pleased to find a movie advertised in English but the content of the movie was in a different language with subtitles.\n",

      "review_text: Movie and Streaming Service going the way of Blockbuster. I am not the first person to complain about this, been a member since 2005, their DVD service had gone downhill. If the movie has a wait, don't expect to get it for at least 4-6 weeks. This was not the case even a year ago. Arrival has a Short Wait period and that currently means about 6 weeks. I have called twice, same response as the last complaint. Reminds me of Blockbuster, they always thought they were too big to go down. It's gotten to the point where I often get the movie on HBO or Star before I get the DVD then I cancel it. Also, whatever service they use for streaming is horrible. 50% of the time it's not in HD. My GF has Amazon, thankfully, we can generally get HD all of the time, and of course Comcast streaming which is always HD.\n",

It's 1 month after the release date and I'm still on a \"short wait\". My hypotheses are 1) They didn't buy very many copies of the DVD to rent out; or 2) They didn't apply any sort of first signed up, first sent to system which leads to 3) They didn't plan for all the Academy Award watchers basing all of their movie selections on what's nominated and did not have the forethought to apply #s 1 or 2 above. \n",

On the down side, I feel Netflix could add some more movies/TV shows pertaining to the family entertainment and the classics. There needs to be a more scrutiny when categories matching entertainment especially in the children's categories (example: movies that are inappropriate for children).

Unfortunately maybe the new customers like it. It's no advantage to me. I joined Amazon Prime. Much to my surprise it takes so long to upload a movie. They're more expensive than Netflix. They have the same movies. Some of the movies that Amazon has I don't know where they came from the horrible. They have movies that I already saw. So my outcome is neither one are good.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix dvd service is best for new releases... but they do everything in their power to discourage users choosing to receive new releases on their release date. The latest of their ever-evolving strategies is to feature a DVD COMING SOON category, sorted by release date... but purposely omit the most popular ones, hoping viewers won't notice the movie and request it. Their objective, I suspect, is to avoid spending money acquiring DVDs. You can often wait weeks for a newly released dvd, because their inventory is so low! Other strategies include reducing their work week from 6 to 5 days, closing Saturdays. They also slow acknowledgement of dvd receipt. If they receive your dvd on Friday... they may wait till Monday tell you it arrived. Pretty nasty.\n",

When the mailman -- yet again! -- neglected to pick up my outgoing movie, Netflix promised to send out a new one the next morning, but I found this never happened. Am calling Netflix almost twice a week now, in an effort to get an agent to do what they say they will do.

It was scheduled to come out a few days before my direct deposit and I didn't want an overdraft fee. The lady I talked to told me to call back two days later and ask to put my account on hold for five days, which would be more than enough time for my deposit to go in. When I did, the lady I talked to was extremely unwilling to help me. She said it was too late for them to put a hold on my account, that they have two million customers to deal with and that if I had called two days earlier, it may have been possible. I told her I did call two days earlier and was told to call two days later! Anyhow, even though I've been with Netflix for many years and have always had the money in the bank to cover the payment and have never called to request a hold, she wouldn't budge. \n",

Secondly their software does not support the most current version of windows I.E. even though it's suppose to. I have to use third party browsers to utilize the streaming. Third their streaming application needs severe fixing. It's slow, laggy, times out, freezes and often forgets what's being watched. Fourth their dvds require a waiting list. With the no return date it can be months of waiting before you receive a disk. New releases need to be added to your waiting list the minute they put them on unless you want to wait months for it.\n",

The chat window connected me with Marcela, who was helpful and gentle in informing me that Los Gatos is the location of a Netflix office, not the name of a movie and that the charge was just my monthly subscription charge. I was relieved that my bank account was not at risk, and my ego was only slightly scathed.

Looking for UHD/4K/Bluray content I checked out Netflix again. But I had to pay this time to see the content and went for their more expensive UHD package. However once inside it is clear that whatever UHD content that is available is simply somewhere in their list of movies etc. and when you click on a movie (eg Call Saul) you are not informed what the format is or given a choice. When you \"chat\" to anyone at Netflix about this you are just wasting your time - they try to confuse the simple issue with all sorts of nonsense. And for an internet service, guess what - no email facility or other way to get your concerns across. Talk about \"head in the sand\" - unbelievable in the 21st Century.

Why on earth would I want two separate services with the same company and 2 separate billings? Sounds like a scam. Then I call the Customer service line. They have no idea, and don't care. If I really wanted to waste an entire day to request to speak with a human to request I be refunded for two separate services/billings to me for however many months they were billing me for two separate services. Then I decide to read up on some reviews to see if others have the same issue. Imagine that, I am not the only one! \n",

      "review_text: Viewing movies on Netflix has been an enjoyable experience for me, so far. They have a great selection to choose from and I like how they can be filtered by category, making it easier to look for specific types of movies that I'm in the mood to see. I appreciate the site making movie suggestions based on what I've viewed recently and I find it awesome that they have so many original series of sorts to choose from. However, I noticed that they hardly have any Disney/Pixar movies available. I think it'd be great to see them available there as they're good for my daughter and nieces to watch, and myself too. But apart from that, Netflix has been a reliable companion during days or nights of free time and relaxation.\n",

This time they never sent me any email but shut off my account. When I called, Marcus told me that he needed the last 8 digits of my old VISA card.

Netflix tried to blame it on TiVo, then realized that they make changes to test out different options. Customer Service said that it is their hope that customers will call in to let them know what they like and don't like. Really? \"What we can do for you\" they said, \"is give your feedback to the decision makers and if enough people feel the same way, we will change it\". When I told them that that didn't feel like they were doing something for me, they said \"well, we would hate to lose you as a customer, but if you are unhappy, we could close your account\".

      "review_text: To start I only stream for $8.00 a month. Approx. 3 wks ago my Netflix came due and since I was running low on money in my bank acct I decided to buy a $20 gift card so I wouldn't chance over drafting because we think my bank acct was hacked. Called in the card and they took it over the phone. Several hrs later still no Netflix. Called them up again and they finally turned it on. Several days later that week it was turned off again for payment. I called them up and they tell me they didn't know how to make the card apply to my acct, but somehow they turned it on again. The same thing happened a week later. Then again this week. So when I asked to speak to the supervisor, Kerry put on Calvin. Calvin proceeds to tell me that they need to charge my bank account in order to apply the $20 card I purchased.\n",

So, after 4 calls to Netflix support I ended up calling Panasonic since Netflix support would not help otherwise. Panasonic fixed my problem in less than 5 minutes. The problem was the DNS. Netflix had changed their servers and for some reasons my DNS did not change. Once I changed the DNS, everything started working.\n",

When did they get the right to renegotiate my terms/contract and get away with going from movies being here next day to 3-4 days for each movie? So I'm still paying the same rate for 1/4 the service.

You are not compensated in any way for the time you have been forced to waste in your subscription when you receive a damaged disc. So - if you watched a DVD on the day you received it, you would be able to watch X number of discs each month that you are paying for. If you lose time by not being able to watch a damaged disc, you have been ripped off. Netflix makes no provision to compensate paying members for lost time.\n",

Only its first season is available on DVD, yet there have been four seasons (and Netflix owns that particular series!). When I complained, the rep told me that all she could do is note my complaint. She said the problem is the limited amount of DVDs that Netflix is now producing. It is much cheaper for Netflix to stream. As a matter of fact, \"The Killing's\" four seasons are available via streaming. Unfortunately, for those of us who cannot obtain unlimited Internet in our area, streaming is too costly for our limited GBs. Another Netflix-produced series is \"House of Cards\". Its third season premiere was February 27. It has been at the #1 spot on my queue since it became available on DVD. I have yet to receive it -- 8 months later.\n",

It may be a small amount of money, and I am sure there are thousands of people who are being double billed right now and don't even know it.

I started with Netflix when streaming was included with the DVD rental. Not a bad deal at all when all I had to do is pay $7.99 plus tax for the DVD service and get unlimited streaming video. When the company decided to start charging for the streaming as well, I thought it was still a good deal.\n",

Initially Netflix was really good provider of Blu-ray disks and I really enjoyed watching movies in high quality. Unfortunately this is not true anymore. 50-75% of disks are damaged, so I have to replace them. So, it takes few days to replace the disk and I actually see 1-2 movies per month due to poor quality of their disks. Will strongly recommend to avoid Netflix and to find someone normal. This fake movie provider can't be considered anymore.\n",

I explained we are in the tech industry and have done all appropriate troubleshooting and still having issues and he basically said he could email me instructions for troubleshooting (didn't we just cover that??) and refused to hear that there might actually be an issue on Netflix's end. He went on to said Netflix was a bandwidth hog, then he proceeded to laugh and reiterate that he would send me instructions for troubleshooting (really, is a third time necessary??). I went on to try and explain I was hoping to get a credit on our account for the inconvenience and he proceeded in giving me two options, cancel my subscription or use the troubleshooting instructions. \n",

I was quite taken aback with Netflix. It was not at Hulu either. What the heck? I found it right away at Amazon but for $2.99 rental. This is a great Clint Eastwood movie. What's the deal? The more I look through the Netflix library, it's mostly old crap mixed with a few teaser movies and who watches old TV reruns? Amazon Prime is basically the same but much more user friendly. Goodbye Netflix! At least with AP for my $99 I get free shipping plus all the extras. Netflix is full of themselves. It seems my \"smart\" TV is not so smart!\n",

Thus, in their service algorithm, we should be prioritized customers. To add insult to injury, when one calls (no e-mail with Netflix), one only gets a series of truisms read from a script, and absolutely no help or attempt to solve the issue. We've been paying Netflix for years, but now we have to buy the shows individually to stream on Amazon, because Netflix is such a disaster. My wife & I feel robbed by Netflix.\n",

This is patently incorrect. The DVDs I send them are posted in as little as 12 hours from the time I place it in the mailbox. A quick search of the internet shows this problem is well documented and many others are being told the same lie. Netflix is throttling heavy users and using the Post Office as an excuse. I hope the Post Office sues Netflix for defamation.\n",

(I know they are sending them later because the email mailing messages arrive much later). A Netflix representative acknowledged I will be getting half as many DVDs but also said that Netflix has no plans to reduce its price.

He didn't know why and said this must be something new they are doing. Usually you got a discount for buying a year in advance, which ran under $100. But now they only sell gift cards in $30 and $60 increments which with them raising new subscriptions to around $11 a month, you can't even get a year unless you get 2 cards at $60 dollars and one more at $30 dollars. \n",

I was charged for over a yr having never used or been able to access Netflix. Notice I had a recurring withdraw from my checking. Called and he said \"think of it as having a gym membership if not cancelled.\" I told them Netflix said I needed to subscribe. Anyways I didn't get refunded.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix added the selection to choose \"me\" or \"kids\" viewing when Netflix is opened or when it wakes from sleep. I and many other people do not have kids and will never select the kids option. Yet I must click the selection every time I want to watch any content. It's a useless feature to me. This selection should clearly be set up as an option for people with children. Why bother the rest of us with this. I'm sure parents enjoy this feature but why not allow the rest of us to turn this off.Amazon prime is sounding pretty good to me these days.\n",

Also, DVD service is no longer available on Saturday and when you restart your DVD service on say Friday morning, your first DVD is not mailed out until the following Tuesday, yet your next billing date is exactly 30 days from the moment they took your money. So they use your money for 5 days and you sit with nothing. Don't bother calling customer service, canned responses, upbeat, annoying youngsters who are either rude or TOO bubbly. Just not what it used to be.\n",

May not have the in progress tv series to catch up on, but it does usually allow the season prior on most shows. It outbeats having to pay for the on demand feature of cable.

      "review_text: Sure, it's only $7.99 per month but it seems like the majority of searches I do come up with zero results. Or else I get a page of various movies or TV shows that have nothing to do with the item I was looking for. It also seems like I get pages of search results of the same content over and over again--most of it new shows that I have no interest in but they seem to be trying to promote. Another bothersome thing is that when I do a search on a favorite actor, the results are their lesser known, lesser successful movies. I think I would have to subscribe to both the streaming service and the DVD service in order to see whatever I want. I used to have the DVD service and was able to get almost every movie you could imagine. They really need to add more options to their streaming service.\n",

He then reset my password but the reset email didn't go out (another issue the rep said they'd been experiencing). I was on the phone for more than 45 minutes trying to resolve the issue when I finally got frustrated and hung up. Two days later, I called customer service to see if they'd fixed their issues. They had and I'm finally on. Their resolution was to credit me for 2 days of viewing. What they should do, is pay me for 1 hour of tech support. This infuriates me and I'm going to look for an alternative to this service. Any organization that has customer service like this company deserves to be out of business.\n",

If you are looking for a way to throw away your hard-earned free time, throw it away on something other than Netflix. Maybe fly a kite, take up remote control car racing, collect action figures or baseball cards, just don't go down this road. I'm not going to reiterate what countless others have said about [low quality] selection of films and shows. I'd rather accept the fact that I paid for said selection knowing exactly what it was and still found myself insanely disappointed in the quality of service. Features such as 'my list' where one saves movies they'd like to see in the future is available 'sometimes'. Movies will often load to a screen that literally says \"whoops, something went wrong...\" \n",

      "review_text: Netflix is really a 5-star company in many respects. Considering how many subscribers they have, they do provide outstanding customer support. For example, from the get-go, you call and regularly have you wait no more than a minute and the reps are always professional and do help you to resolve issues. If you receive a damaged disc, they will send a replacement plus an extra disc. One complaint has to do with the fee for ordering Blu-ray discs. I have a Blu-ray disc player but have never used a Blu-ray disc. I asked if I could order a disc, see if I like the Blu-ray effect and thereby decide if it would be worth it to subscribe to their Blu-ray program. \"No. No. Cannot. You have to pay the general fee.\" What would be so difficult about allowing a customer to try it out, for a small fee? All of that kind of stuff is a matter of programming computers, which shouldn't be like programming a rocket launch to the moon, FGS!\n",

It gets more fishy. I google \"Fargo TV series, Netflix\" when logged out of Netflix, and this is what their page for Fargo TV says: \"Rent unlimited DVDs, including Fargo, for only $7.99 a month.\" \"Including\" Fargo, it says. This is false advertisement, plain and simple. Their DVDs available for rent do not include the Fargo TV show.

I would like to make a very serious complaint, first about the service you have provided me and secondly, about the terribly, terribly rude and upsetting manner that I have just been spoken to by one of your terrible customer services providers in Texas Imyman at 18.21 today (21.07.14).\n",

I did that several months ago and instead of changing the email, it ADDED an email, and hence a new account. Netflix will not refund the double payments charged. It is my opinion if one does not have the option of changing their email without talking to them (which they now advise) it should be removed as a changeable option on the account info page.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix, a good idea, but only about the money. First and foremost, the quality of every show/movie varies but almost all at some point will be reduced to 1980 VHS quality grainy visuals. That problem takes back burner when presented with the most glaring problem Netflix has - Disappearing movies/TV shows. I have multiple times watched a movie only to find it missing when I recommend it to a friend. These - off the top of my head- include Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Cowboy Bebop and various others. It's annoying to say the least when a service you pay for starts denying you exactly what is says it will deliver. \n",

      "review_text: Netflix picture quality is now totally worthless and the large majority of subscribers are unable to view in HD (720p, 1080p) or even SD (480p) during prime time and weekends. The ISPs are not throttling the speed. Netflix Content Delivery Network Servers cannot handle the demand. Netflix seems to want it all without the expense of building their own CDNS (Content Delivery Network Servers). Instead Netflix should be building far more regionally located Netflix CDN Servers to meet their customer demand and not relying on the ISPs to shoulder the load. While they call it Open Connect, Netflix is actually closing off access to some of its content while seeking unprecedented preferential treatment from ISPs. \n",

      "review_text: I decided to get Netflix after hearing so many positive reviews from people that I knew. I got my account back when they were offering streaming and DVD in the same package for just $10.00/month. Honestly, It was a deal. I took advantage of that service and still do, only without the DVDs. The stream selection was good enough and the DVD selection made up for what the stream was lacking. I ended up having a lot of free time after work and weekends, due to putting myself on a strong no spending, cut debt program. So Netflix served as great entertainment for those days spent at home. I would invite friends over and we would watch movies on stream or I would get a DVD within days. Overall, my experience was positive. I never had an experience of a DVD been lost in the mail or anything like that. The stream has crashed a couple of times since I've had it but no big deal.\n",

If you try to kill the account and open another account, they continue to bill the first account as well as the new account. They do not close accounts when you request it after their history of double billing.\n",

Everything to choose from was either really old, or one of those dumb spoof-type movies that you've never heard of that go straight to DVD. After two months, I noticed I was still being charged. I called customer service and they told me that a \"stupid hacker kid\" had gotten my info, opened an account and charged it to my card. How in the world does a hacker get my info? From their database. It seems like Netflix needs to work on their security. I will be receiving a refund, but the entire experience was subpar. I would not recommend this service to others. Go to Redbox instead.\n",

Additionally, Netflix is not violating the law by keeping money for services not rendered to me. I have removed Netflix from my Christmas card list forever. Maybe I'll write a book about \"How Not to Win Friends and Influence People\".\n",

It started out great in the beginning. Over the last year, the service has gone into intolerable decline. Three out of ten viewings are reliable. The other 7 go like this: (1) loads a show; (2) the show starts; (3) 10 seconds into show, it STOPS to reload (takes 30 seconds); (4) the show starts and rolls for 20 seconds to 2 minutes at most, and STOPS to reload (takes 30 seconds); and (5) the show starts and rolls for 20 seconds to 2 minutes at most, and STOPS to reload (takes 30 seconds). \n",

The customer service people will argue with you and refuse to respect, even respect what you are saying as a customer. My son ordered the service on his credit card when he got low on money because he is in college. We called customer service and changed the credit card. The lady took the card over the phone and said it was changed. Then the next month, it was billed back on my son's card, and we were charge a NSF of $30.00. So we called and the customer service rep said the other rep left the other card on file and should have removed it. They tried to bill my card and it would not work which was not true at all because I had no problem on my account. \n",

      "review_text: This has to do with the \"save queue\". Many shows and movies have to go to this queue because Netflix does not release them in a timely fashion. I was told that if you put a show or movie in this \"save queue\" you will be sent your DVD in the order in which the save request was received. So the earlier you request this, the sooner the item should arrive. Not so! They let the item out a day sooner than posted, and it goes to their preferred clients or employees, but not the general public, some of whom, like myself waited for over 6 months patiently. I canceled their service and will never return. This is more than maddening, but the basis of very bad business - all of those years being overcharged for this service and then to be treated so unfairly! If they don't survive, here is an excellent reason why. This is discrimination, pure and simple.\n",

Today, I received an email on an inactive and very old email address advising me that my credit card on file at Netflix had expired and they were about to cancel my account. Well, that card number was cancelled four months ago. So thinking it was some sort of illegal activity, I called customer supportless only to find to my dismay that I have been paying for two accounts for over a year. Sound familiar? Well, you guessed it. They don't intend to refund more than the current billing period even though they confirmed that I had not used the old (other) account in at least a year. God only knows how long I had been paying for two accounts. That states volumes for online credit card statements. Having four credit cards, I wasn't smart enough to realize that I was paying twice each month since the statements come in on the beginning and last week of each month. What can one do? I noticed that I am not alone in this double billing of multiple accounts thing. They must love fools such as me. Folks, beware and pay attention to your charges.\n",

I've rented two DVDs in three months and had been double billed for each month. Instead of realizing perhaps they have gotten their money's worth out of those two DVDs, they insist that customers are more than advised as to each of the DVDs and streaming being 8 dollars each. It used to be combined as I recall, but instead of just refunding just one charge for one month (not a lot for what I've actually paid in three months) totaling just 7 movies total both steaming and DVD, it's sad to say that they were more than happy to ditch a paying customer over $8 and taking time to listen with at least pretending to care.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix fails to deliver! Is this the same company? My first experience with Netflix was positive. They had DVD rentals which I used extensively. Also offered was streaming which I recently signed up for on a free trial and saw the price to be $8 after expiration of trial without DVDs. The first thing I had to do was download a proprietary Microsoft Silverlight, which is a memory hog and simply freezes up the dual processor laptop. Fast hard drive, high power multimedia processor and an expensive internet cable connection. Before I got to the failed Silverlight delivery, I noticed an anemic interface with virtually nothing there that I wanted to view. I selected a movie that I'd seen before and after an hour of several failed attempts, the movie loaded. \n",

      "review_text: I have noticed Netflix is limiting their Christmas movie selection. They have dropped the Christian themed movies whereas Blockbuster carries all of them. This is concerning as one who would like to rent these whether I'm a Christian or not. They are good family oriented films if nothing else. Furthermore, I have also noticed Blockbuster carries a great deal more (whether they have them is another matter and I am by no means advocating or promoting BB) but they do offer more excellent Christian Christmas movies including recent releases. I am re-evaluating whether to continue my subscription. Netflix, I sincerely hope you listen to these complaints as they are valid. It is sad when a company needs competitors to improve their products/services but that is exactly what is needed. Netflix won't listen until another company comes along and gives them a run for their money.\n",

The service I received was the bare minimum, and rather than illustrating that Netflix values their customer through refunding the double charges or providing months at no charge because they were already paid for, Netflix showed they do not care about their customer, but rather only for their money. So Netflix lost me as a customer, which is a shame, because it would have been no out of pocket to them. Just as well, I'd rather not contribute to their greedy mentality.\n",

About 3 weeks ago, I decided to use the DVD one at a time Blu-ray subscription to watch the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. I watched the Walking Dead 1st DVD season 2 then found it on demand on AMC and I watched the rest of it there. On to Game of Thrones.

I had to wait from Friday until Tuesday to get the DVD and watch 53 minutes and then send it back Wednesday to receive the next one Friday without knowing how many episodes are in there, and I don't want to check online.

I got up, leaving my 5 year old on the couch in front of the TV. When you flip through movies on Netflix, it will show clips from the movie. When I got up to get my little one, I came back to find the movie clip showing was extremely inappropriate. There were 2 girls getting their clothing torn off at knife point by some men. The girls were mostly nude and were forced to \"do things\". I was in shock to see that my 5 year old was watching this! The movie is \"The Last House on the Left\" 1972 version. I do not have a problem with this sort of movie, but with the clip that was shown for the movie. I'm sure they could choose a different clip for that movie so that no other children will be exposed to this. I called and spoke to a woman at Netflix. I was told they have no control over what clips are shown nor do they preview the clips before putting them on Netflix. She told me she would send a note and make them (whoever them is) aware of this. That was 3 weeks ago and nothing has changed!\n",

Much to my dismay, I just found out that they no longer offer my favorite show, “Roseanne.” I don't have cable. The only reason I get Netflix is to watch shows. “Roseanne” is all I watched the last time I had it and now that I have it again I can't even watch my damn show. I know they have to pay for licenses to stream the shows and movies, but when their selection is crap to begin with, I don't understand why they can't keep what they have and build on it rather than pick and choose and play the odds.\n",

I understand that movie ratings are a 'guide' for parents to use, and I realize that children can use the \"kids\" link to access appropriate content, but there are no mechanisms for parents to \"block\" content such as this from accidental access. Apple has a fairly strict process for preventing kids from accessing \"explicit content\", but Netflix does not and that is really surprising to me. I think you need to come up with a more family friendly process for using you services on computers, home entertainment systems, mobile devices etc., and enable specific blocking of content. It also wouldn't hurt for you to establish some sort of \"adult\" tier that is not accessible without additional effort by adults.\n",

Having said that, the only ways that you can pay is either through direct monthly charges to one's bank account, credit card, or by buying a paid subscription and then redeeming that subscription so that the monthly charges are deducted from it. The deducted charges from the subscription are not itemized, and so, you do not know exactly what you have left over. Why do they have to make it so difficult? Why can't they just have a way of paying using a credit card, debit card, or bank account where you can buy for instance 12 months in advance for the services you have chosen in your account? It is almost like Netflix is trying to hide earnings from the government, and the way that they charge, it would be very easy to do and the government tax bean counters could never figure it out.

      "review_text: I have several complaints to voice with Netflix now that I have cancelled my account with them. They are not a customer-oriented/-friendly business. They are only accessible via telephone; there is no way to email or contact this company by any other means. They have the one-month hook subscription. I cancelled on the same day as my bill was due, and now must pay for another full month before the cancellation takes effect. They spin this as, \"You can enjoy watching your favorite movies till the subscription runs out.\" Nine out of every 10 movies that I wish to see are only available by mail. This makes having a online streaming-only membership a near complete waste.\n",

      "review_text: Streaming Netflix has three gaping flaws. One, they provide very poor content to the streaming users. This crap should be free, and is free with a service like Hulu. Two, they have a nearly criminal policy when it comes to monthly fees, such as charging bank accounts periodically after cancellation and forcing membership via the one-month trial hook, sometimes failing to honor the trial cancellation. Three, their advertising is intentionally ambiguous when it comes to the stream vs. DVD differences. If you want a lot of cartoons for your child because you don't have cable and hate watching PBS Barney and Sid the Science Kid, then this is for you. If you love to explore a small selection of B movies, then this is for you. If you like being yelled at over the phone by the same people who are stealing from you, then this is for you.

Then I discovered they continued to charge (for at least one account) for several months onward after that. They refused to refund more than two months of the illegal charges, and told me to call my credit card to get the remainder. I will do more than that. I will sue them in small claims court for the $9 per month. What an insane business model. Sign people up, provide bad service so they quit, and then simply keep charging their credit cards.

I only discovered the problem when I put my account on hold. I continued to put it on hold until I saw the charges were no longer deducted. This took from Jan to present, which is March 23, to discover they had been billing both cards since Nov. 2010. \n",

Netflix is banking on that! They will only reimburse me for one month. The man on the phone keeps repeating that I opened a new account and keeps repeating that.

They forced me to go through troubleshooting which included a visit from a tech supervisor at Time Warner who made a printout of a high internet signal proving it was Netflix's poor signal, so when I went back to Netflix ,they said there was nothing they would do, even though I followed their protocol. They continued to remove movies from streaming forcing you to go to DVD. All of the movies are mostly old and positively the worst customer service. They are rude, ambivalent, and uncaring. That includes and describes most of the supervisors I talked to as well.\n",

      "review_text: I will be cancelling my Netflix account when it expires soon.  I got their notice on My Netflix to update my credit card information because my card was expiring soon.  This led to a call to the credit card company as to why they hadn't sent me a new card.  They had, two months earlier, but I never received it. The solution was that they'd send me a new card with a new number for security reasons within ten days.  They would not give me the new credit card number over the phone.  The day before I received my new credit card, and not wanting to use a different card for Netflix, I started streaming a Netflix movie.  It cut out with no warning mid-movie.  I called Netflix and they said that they needed my new credit card information immediately or all service would stop this minute, even though I was prepaid for another week.  The Netflix representative was rude and not at all helpful (company policy and I should read the fine print).  \n",

I went to their website and seen that my account was put on hold, no notification from them or anything. I called and ended up having to talk to a supervisor, who informed me that my account was put on hold on October 21 because they were investigating that out of the last 3 months I reported not receiving two of the DVDs, they said they mailed. But they went ahead and charged my credit card on October 22 for October 22-November 22. I asked him why am I being punished for the US Mail? He said I wasn't, then why am I being charged for a service I am not receiving? He replied, I was not. I then said, \"then why did you charge my credit card?\". I couldn't get a straight answer out of them. I canceled my membership and told him they need to credit my card back. We will see what happens. Ever since they changed their pricing, etc. they have gone down hill. You would think now that if we are paying more, we would have better service. Good riddance!\n",

That is bad policy number one.  The thing that I think is even worse, and the real reason why I am writing this complaint, is that they have no avenue for emailing personally written complaints directly to them.  I can't even find a place to complain about the non-working DVD we just got.

I was totally upset with the service and quality of the movies and DVDs, as well as bad customer service. I would not recommend this service to anyone and will never do business with Netflix again.

They have the opportunity for people to give Netflix as gifts and when the gift membership is completed they dont provide an option, They just start charging the card that has been put in the system after the free membership. There is no option. I personally never used the service during the gift time or afterwards and have subsuqently been charged for quite a while. They in my opinion are charging a fraudulent service and need to provide the appropriate retribution to customers otherwise they are scamming the consumers.\n",

He and my stepmother appreciated that and got a lot of enjoyment out of watching the movies together.  In September 2008, he went into a nursing home, and they quit using the movies.  At that time, I did not believe it appropriate to contact you and cancel the subscription.  My father died in March, 2010.  I would pay for his subscription at one time, instead of monthly installments.\n",

Their response to all complaints is that “I am doing what I need to do,” but I need to be patient because of wait times.  Movies that I have requested have been out for months now.  Months!  Netflix is ripping off their customers and not taking the responsibility for it.\n",

      "review_text: The Netflix streaming service (Watch Instantly), which is available on PS3, is overwhelmed with movies that glorify drugs and/or sexual material. This is not the adult version of Netflix. As a parent, I find it wholly irresponsible that Netflix does not filter this type of adult-oriented content from its streaming service but rather automatically populates the movie queue as new movies become available. This is a disservice to parents that do not want their kids exposed to a distasteful movie line up that can be watched instantly. My wife and I cannot search for movies with our daughter present because every other movie has a glorified drug or sexual title or movie cover. This is absurd for a service that is widely available and accessible by kids, especially on gaming consoles (i.e, PS3, Xbox). Netflix does not offer a search option whatsoever on the PS3 Netflix service, which forces consumers to look at every single movie to find one to watch, making it impossible to bypass inappropriate movies. This is unacceptable and a direct failure of the Netflix service to provide consumers with effective control of the content being displayed.\n",

I waited and waited and waited, but the status never changed from Very Long Wait for more than two months. I ended up renting all of the new releases I wanted to watch on iTunes after waiting for two months. I decided to leave those movies in my queue and watched what happened for another month. They are still in 'Very Long Wait' status. Unbelievable and it's not acceptable. I think they are buying a lot less DVDs and want us to watch old and mediocre movies on instant play.

In the beginning, they only had a few movies, but after a month or two, they really got busy and put a lot on there! When the grandkids are visiting, there is always something for everyone. Very good variety now. I've never been overbilled or had a movie that I sent back get lost (although I'm sure it happens from time to time). Bottom line, our family loves our Netflix! Best $99 I've ever spent and I think they cost less now too!\n",

I tried to contact someone on their site but they don't have an email address for complaints. They have a button that says contact us, but it is a button page. I canceled my account and they gave me a list of options why I did it, but none of them was close to: You renigged on the one month free trial and tried to trick me into signing up for an extra movie a week at my expense in a couple days, when you know I still have about 15 days left by playing games with the dates. That is what the option I would have liked to have told them. They try to slow play customers out of their free month and then, get this, the movie selection is not new releases. I decided I can go to the RedBox on the corner cheaper, faster, and I never get lied to or cheated.\n",

So I kept the movies and cancled the account, and they made a lot of money off of me. There should be some kind of limit to how much they can continue to charge.

The policy states no charges will be made to your card unless you do not return the DVDs.  I used the service 4 times and returned all DVDs (Netflix shows them checked in) but when I went on line to select another DVD, I was told there was a problem with my credit card and to verify it.  I clicked verify and made my selection.  Then I tried to use my credit card the next day only to discover the bank had placed a hold on it. It seems Netflix attempts to charge $1.00 to your card each month to verify the card is still valid.  The Credit card company sees this activity as fraudulent and puts a hold on your card, then cancels your card and re-issues a new one to prevent further fraud.  Now, I have to wait 7 days to get a valid card replacement.  Netflix does not advise you of this procedure in advance so you can advise the credit card company. I have 2 months left on my gift subscription but Netflix refuses to honor it until I give them another credit card to replace the one they managed to get canceled for me.   \n",

Instead, the only option is to cancel your account immediately, so you lose any time left in the 30-day cycle and have to send any DVDs you have back within seven days or they'll charge your credit card for them. Isn't the consumer ENTITLED to finish out the rest of their subscription, since they've paid for it?  I did reach them by phone, and the rep said he had no way to end the subscription by not renewing the charge on my credit card, the fair and honest way. The only way to end the subscription is for the consumer to cancel immediately while online. This is a very rude, extremely unhelpful, and unfriendly way to treat supposedly valued customers! Isn't there a law against this kind of one-way approach? So now I have to remember to go online and cancel before my card is charged on November 10.

      "review_text: Their concept is good, and if you tend to rack up late fees on rented dvds, a great one. Big problem is if you get a defective DVD and it skips, stops, even after cleaning it off. This happened more than a few times, and they only offered to replace it, not refund any of the monthly fee of $22. I figured I was receiving one defective DVD for every five good ones, a bad ratio, esp. if the skipping begins somewhere after an hour into the movie.The straw that broke the camel's back was they sent me a replacement (one I had viewed for nearly the entire film) that didn't play at all. Their customer service people aren't reasonable, and if you tend to rent out a lot of DVDs over the month, they'll put you into a delayed churn, trying to get you to cancel because they're not making a profitable margin off you.\n",

Since then, every new release I request is at least a short wait and most are a long or very long wait (which amounts to 2-3 months to receive the DVD requested). No matter the price, nobody wants to wait 3 months to view a new release - especially when you can run down to Blockbuster and rent it within a week of its release. Netflix has a monthly churn rate of 7% which means they lose 84% of their customers annually - a recipe for disaster and if they hope to remain in existence, they should ensure they have enough of the new releases on hand to satisfy all of their subscribers.\n",

Futhermore, no notice of this charge was given to me until I received my credit card bill and $31.95 is a ridiculously high charge for a used, badly scratched DVD.

In case you don't know what \"Cuties\" is about, it is about little 11- and 12-year-old girls twerking and dancing naked in a dance competition. I'm sorry. I don't know the whole scenario and I don't want to know! They came back with these responses: \"'Cuties\" is an important coming-of-age film that shows how young girls act at a young age...\", \"It is a MUST WATCH film...\", and \"We have no plans of removing the film from our library.\"! I feel very disheartened about NetFlix. I feel that they are hiding secrets that they do not want us to know! I will NEVER RENT ANOTHER MOVIE FROM THEM, AGAIN! Viewers who watch the movie are considered pedophiles.\n",

But after reading other reviews of double payments I'm beginning to question the honesty of this company. With 183 million subscribers you'd only have to double charge a few unnoticed million to make a lot more money. They will not refund my 10 months they charged me for the stranger's subscription. I'm a senior and can't afford someone cheating me. IMO...not an honest company.\n",

The different programs that is available is too much so that you can not miss any entertainment. The price I pay is $8.99 and this is very reasonable. I love Netflix that they will always send a list of the top ten programming that is available. Netflix has been in my family for over five years and we enjoy it very much.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix is a very good streaming service that has a variety of selections both movies and episodes. They are really good at explaining each movie before you view it. They also rate them and that is important. The only negative thing is that it doesn't have that much of a selection and now with the quarantine it helps to have a greater selection of items to watch. I also like the format when choosing what to watch as opposed to Hulu that has the list up and down without really telling you what the movie or episode is all about. I highly recommend Netflix but hope they get more inventory.\n",

Until we start receiving some compensation from government, we asked netflix customer service to extend the complimentary period by one more month and then we would sign up with the monthly fee. They offered us that they could do $8.99 service which we know we can do that. It was more like an insult to us. \n",

This was obviously not great but you could put up with it just to watch some U.S. stuff. Recently Nextflix announced that they would be reducing their bit rate in international markets, and now the stream drops every 2 or 3 minutes and takes around a minute to come back up. Unsure how they expect to keep any customers if they keep doing this. Standard cable TV over the same external pipes from the home here in Hungary continue to work just fine. So this appears to be strictly a Netflix issue.\n",

When I contacted the customer service, they said they cannot give the details but they suspected fraud and they cancelled my subscription. But, they said, I can renew my subscription.

      "review_text: Just like Mike in Louisville, I have been a long time Netflix 3-at-home DVD service customer. But in the last 2 months, it seems all my in-queue, released to the public DVDs (now over 20 at this writing) show either a \"short wait\" or \"long wait\". So I sit waiting for many days with no DVD despite turning around their sent DVDs quickly. When I called to complain they say that the problem is \"high demand\" to which I countered that the real problem is \"low supply\". So my account (and Mike's) are obviously very profitable for Netflix because I pay full price and get 20% of what I pay for. With the $17.23/month I now pay Netflix, I can buy 3 streaming services each month that I now do not have. Sadly, I believe the corporate strategy for Netflix is to discourage the DVD service subscribers so they can eventually eliminate mailing DVDs and move everyone to the much more profitable streaming service. Once again, corporate greed wins the day.\n",

I asked him how could that happen for the last 3 times? It should have been automatically cancel my membership once they sent the email and that there should not have been any “agent” manually canceling my account! He just apologized and did nothing else. I proceeded to ask if they do this often to their members and try to see if they can swindle more money from them if they don’t call to confirm. He said... \"No.\"\n",

I waited on hold for 15 minutes to speak to a manager at Netflix (who I am fairly certain was not in a management role).

They up their prices but the DVDs that I get through the mail are extremely slow to get delivered. I probably get maybe 1 dvd a week if I'm lucky, where before I was getting around 3. And it seems like you have to have the dvd subscription if you want to watch anything good. Even really old movies can only be found through the dvd service most of the time. And the streaming selection is good but it takes a really long time to get new stuff on there. I'm a big fan of horror movies and we constantly see the same selections that have been there for months before a new one becomes available. So basically they charge more and I get less.

      "review_text: I live in a rural part of N.M. and have been with Netflix DVD for over a year. I ALWAYS sent 2 movies back on Mondays. I had to call and report that I rarely get two movies back by Friday. I would receive one movie back by Thursday, but they waited to send me that second movie until Thursday. Often times, that would leave me actually paying for two movies a week, but only receiving one a week. I would have to call every time and tell them \"both movies were scanned at my post office on Monday, but \"I only received one movie back!\" They would send me out two, and make good for it, but I would have to call and complain every 4 to 5 weeks. This has gone on for over a year, so I dropped my plan back to one movie a week. It's a big issue to me to send out only one movie a week on a two movie a week plan.\n",

      "review_text: In June 2019, Netflix contacted me to do three time-consuming surveys, including watching videos. I did all three surveys because I was told I would receive 4 free months service as compensation. I waited 3 weeks after completion... Nothing. Called Netflix and was told that within 7 (additional) days I would receive a gift card to be used for the free service. Waited another 2 weeks. Nothing. Emailed Netflix CEO... Nothing. Netflix lied to me and scammed me, and yes, their customer service confirmed that the surveys and the free service offer had come directly from Netflix. Between being cheated by Netflix in this way, and their pathetic offerings recently, we cancelled service after many, many years of being disc and streaming customers. I don't want to do business with a company I can't trust, and Netflix has turned into one of those companies.\n",

They recognized my old account in in about 2 minutes I was up and running. Then I checked the billing area just to make sure it was free and it's then I determined I was being billed. I called Netflix and they said since I had once had a free trial, that I was no longer eligible. I told them the email said, \"Enjoy another free trial\" and they said read the fine print. Sure enough, the fine print said no additional free trials although in bold print the email sent to me which was from my previous registration said, \"Enjoy another free trial\".

That's why if you do the physical disks via Netflix or anywhere you can get anything but the online streaming you can't find anything and have to find whichever service paid large outlay to solo license for multiple years a specific piece of content. \n",

Then she wanted the last 8 digits of my credit card. I asked why she needed more sensitive information and she said it was for security. I told her that I have the right to know what number is on the account and she still refused. I asked for the last four numbers of the phone number if she was worried I would call someone. She still refused insisting on the last 8 of my credit card.\n",

      "review_text: We have been Netflix customers since 2005. Initially for DVDs and more recently for streaming, and adding roughly over $2000 to Netflix profitability, helping make them one of the big guys (FAANG). Well, NOT ANY LONGER. Netflix has become too big and proves once again how power corrupts. Netflix used to provide a very good and diverse service. They should have stayed with that model! They now present their users with how to think (politically), which means they are not to be trusted as a service or with our personal data. They put politicians on their board, cater to one-sided political productions, and sensor out diverse productions that are not to their liking. I will be canceling our Netflix service today, and thank ConsumerAffairs for this opportunity to voice my dissatisfaction with Netflix. P.S. I am adding ConsumerAffairs to my website. Thanks again.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix was my favorite streaming website for years. It offers a wide selection of tv shows and movies and the layout felt easier to use that others like Amazon Prime or Hulu. It always had something for me to watch and I could usually find the shows I loved on it. For a while, it was improving. More shows. Better shows. Shows from all over the world. More language options. More anime even, a guilty pleasure of mine. As of the past year, it's gone downhill though. They've upped the price while removing a lot of my favorite shows. What used to be the place where I could catch up on shows I loved and rewatch old favorites or binge new series, has become a place of frustration as they literally remove shows while I'm in the middle of watching them. And there isn't even a warning! Many shows like Switched at Birth, Being Human, and so many more have been removed. \n",

I don't say all of them are bad, but the most is just time-killer, even, though Netflix service is not for free. That's sad like, the positions on Netflix library are given us based on their popularity or price of the license and that's pointless to look for underground movies, less popular or just the older ones. Love Netflix, but still it's not a nice thing when for example \"Cloud Atlas\" is being replaced by \"The Perfect Date\".\n",

Granted, I didn’t expect much out of them since the first time this happened and called - they wouldn’t honor the old pricing either, but I thought maybe there was a chance that their policies had changed. Not so. \n",

I like the interface, speed, etc. and it works with all my stuff. Keeps everything synced between different TVs. Makes mirroring or beaming pictures onto the big screen a breeze. All-in-all it's my favorite and the best experience if you use other Apple products. Amazon Prime, YouTube, SlingTV, and many other Apps are available.\n",

Lastly I had several problems that took a lot a time to solve; one of my former account that I didn't use anymore had been hacked; I saw that 9.99 GBP had been removed from my bank account on February 8th and March 8th (normally I pay 9.99$CA every 20th of the month); though this amount has been refunded, I am really surprised that no one was even able to notify me unusual activities on this account. And the only way for me to secure this account was to change the e-mail address+password, to reactivate the account, and then to pay 9.99$ the subscription. Of course, I cancelled my subscription right away, but the 9.99$ that has been taken from my account still hasn't been refunded, though all of this happened on March 8th. \n",

The new release DVDs weren't usually available until a few weeks after being publicly released so I found I didn't use the service as much as I wanted so decided to cancel. I followed all directions and requested no further DVDs be sent. Netflix noted they sent a DVD after cancel, I listed this as never received and I returned my last DVD in time. Netflix has charged me for nonreturn of a DVD after canceling. After researching online this appears to be Netflix's standard business practice. Buyer beware, if canceling, clear your queue and return all DVDs where Netflix acknowledges receipt and then cancel so you are not charged for a \"nonreturned\" DVD. I was planning to activate streaming service, after this dishonest business practice Netflix will never receive another dime from me.\n",

That means yet another week to wait for a replacement! They clearly do not check their DVDs before they are sent out to the next customer.

      "review_text: Netflix has way too many movies and series that have way too much sick, explicit, and ugly sex scenes. Most stories can be told without all of that. I really do not like seeing people do all this stuff on my TV screen. If the same scenes played out on public streets, the individuals involved would be arrested for indecent exposure. The TV screen should be treated like a public place. It also has way too many programs in languages other than English. I only speak one language, so reading subtitles is a distraction from the movie for me. Much of what is being communicated is lost, because there is not enough time to see facial expressions, and emotions which are the non-verbal forms of communicating.\n",

Usually though sometimes when I first turn on Netflix, it returns to where I was last and then says that it's unavailable and then I just restart it and it's fine. When it really misbehaves, I learned a special trick, you unplug the TV while it is tuned to Netflix and this always works like a charm.\n",

I find that it has an extensive library of entertainment and have enjoyed countless hours of viewing. I’ve watched so many shows and movies that I even keel a list of all my favorites which I happily supply to my family and friends who ask for recommendations. I feel like I’ve become quite a connoisseur of entertainment. I have especially enjoyed the many British and Australian shows; most of which I would probably have never gotten a chance to watch if it hadn’t been for Netflix. I also particularly like the Netflix original series - of course, starting with Orange is the New Black. I watch almost each and every recommendation that the service offers to me and it’s always on point!\n",

Sometimes it happens but I think it's a buffering problem as we have several devices connected simultaneous. I'm NOT really satisfied with the movie/shows content. Too much of the same even under various categories. Better or more choices would be better.\n",

Basically, they make it very difficult to actually find a variety in their offerings. I have regularly told them their volume level is low. (NOT a problem with my computer.) When first arriving at the site, you are subjected to a preview of whatever they're touting at the moment. Unless you scroll immediately, you will be subjected to this preview. Live chats are all but worthless. Must assume that most of their representatives do not have English as their first language.\n",

I like the interface as a general note, but the way they organize movies can be confusing. I would prefer a more straight-forward directory structure. The biggest complaint is the content. While they get a lot of the bigger movies, at the same time I feel there is a lot left off. At the same time, the NF original content has been pretty good and if they continue, NF could be a real player in the cord-cutting, play-on-demand world.\n",

I would like to them more in-line with Hulu in providing new Network content a few days after it airs; however not understanding the complexities of licensing and contract structure, that may not be a viable/profitable road for them. They are the best and handling bandwidth during peak hours as I never see a streaming issue with Netflix as I do with some of the other major streaming services. There is definitely room to branch out on TV content and perhaps some local options in the future. All in all, Netflix is our go to service.\n",

It never reflected the information he stated it did. They also stated their system did not show the trial request being completed, although it was. Netflix also stated that everyone signs up the same way whether it is a Free Trial or not. Tried to set up again, to check for any information about being ineligible, and nothing states you are not eligible. Also was told that I had to call in seven days for a refund of the money I did not know I was being charged. Because I did not call in seven days the charge cannot be refunded according to their policy. Netflix is very interested in keeping their fee, and very uninterested in retaining a customer.\n",

It's my TV! Not a phone or tablet. My family gathers around our home TV to watch a Netflix movie and customer service for Netflix tells me I can still watch it on my cell phone or laptop!!! I asked for a supervisor to speak to and this guy put me on hold and when he came back, he tells me he spoke to his supervisor and they said there's nothing I can do about it. \n",

      "review_text: If you have ever gone to the movies then this isn't the site to use. The offerings are old and a lot of foreign films with bad ratings. It is boring at best. Amazon at least offers movies that you can research using names of directors and actors but Netflix is outdated and not worth the time. I travel a lot so that on a sail or just on my laptop it is useless. It is perhaps ok for those who haven't used it but after about three months the pickings get slim as they take movies away and then put them back again. They need to update their programming and get a large selection of great films not bad and the ones with two stars forget about them. I am disappointed and more. It is time for an upgrade Acorn or Amazon.\n",

      "review_text: Netflix halted all user comments this year for a reason. The company is going international and spending our membership fees to finance \"Netflix\" movies and international \"foreign\" language movies. The company has moved away from offering American films, and forced us to choose from Netflix options that makeup for the most part Netflix movies and documentaries, or international movies posted for the benefit of those non-english speaking citizens. My monthly dollars are not going where I chose them to go originally. Many customers feel the same, thus BIG \"NETFLIX\" halted our ability to comment on our service. Where the HELL are customer rights!!! Members - if Netflix is your only TV option, try Netflix Prime, or give Netflix a wake up call, and leave comments.\n",

I called customer service and spent an hour on the phone to be told they didn't know what was wrong, not to contact my bank as they won't know either. Called the bank anyway and they didn't know. Called customer service back. Was told to use a gift card, purchased one and still wouldn't work so contacted the help center again, they told me there was nothing they could do so I requested a supervisor and they told me there wasn't any. I eventually got through to a manager who just repeated there was nothing I could do, after trying to load the £20 gift card onto the account it still won't work or let me use the gift card elsewhere. I was then told they couldn't do anything and even when I tried to set up a new account I had the same issue. I tried on the TV, my phone, a tablet, laptop, PC and firestick and the same issue every time. \n",

I called to report it and my account was put on hold until an investigative team could get back to me in 72 hours. I had called to speed up the process which had stalled, and Netflix delayed it further as a response. This is the second time this has happened over a period of years. It happened a year or so ago when I reported a few movies not being removed promptly from the at home list after being returned. That time the rep threatened to close my account. Do not expect Netflix to be concerned with the impact of their incompetence, customer unfriendly policies, and poor quality of service. They retaliate. Given that they are largely a monopoly, this is very serious behavior.\n",

Checking my bank statement I realized I've been double billed by Netflix for two years. Yes, I should have found this sooner, but life is hard and no paper bills or statements anymore. I have trouble going online, so I didn't. Contacted Netflix. They agreed I've been double-billed, but they will only refund 3 months. They knew that this was happening, but continued to take my money. They never contacted me, they just continued to take my money. I guess they needed that $10.99 a month more than I do.

However, they were able to identify my account and tell me this... and asked for my credit card information to verify my identity. None of this made any sense to me. I find it alarming in this day and age that an online subscription has live customer service available who cannot put a hold on account to protect a victim from fraud.

Sometimes, I am already listening to music while I browse Netflix for something to watch, and it is incredibly annoying when one of these previews start playing. If they would at least let customers CHOOSE to watch a preview, it would make more sense. Most of the time I am so irritated that I close the browser window without choosing anything.

While searching for it again, everything I mouse over starts chattering away, as if I'm interested. Netflix is no longer relaxing. It's just annoying.

We've been patient and understanding about half of our choices not being available on Netflix... they are on the DVD format... just not at Netflix... that's the first issue. However, what we are finding more and more often in the last year or two... which is much more frustrating... is that we now find ourselves waiting not just for weeks, but for MONTHS, for one disc in our queue. Mind you, this is something that is on DVD, that Netflix has, that they let us add to our queue... but one disc has been on 'very long wait' for three months now. This happens a lot!!! A 'very very lot'. \n",

My story starts on Nov or October of 2017 when I was intrigued by what Netflix had to offer, saw the commercials and was especially turned on by the 30 free trial. I knew of the company prior to joining and how they started with renting DVDs which quickly put blockbuster out of business. Long story short I had an account cancel due to nonpayment once and assumed I had no account. Little did i know that someone started the account back without me knowing changed my email address so they have been Netflix and chilling with my bloody programs.

Because Netflix doesn't pay royalties on their own ** content. There are very very very very few movies on Netflix that are worth watching. Most are very low budget and old AF...

You will need to contact your financial institution to dispute the rest of the charges.” When I told him it wasn't a good enough answer and Netflix are happy to take double payment and then shrug their shoulders when they are pulled up on it. \n",

We are in America people NOT these other countries. Also if you're NOT into the Netflix original programming (I'm not) then all I 'mostly' see are the same old movies they never get rid of or again the international movies that are subtitled. It's not worth the price hike. As a matter of fact I just cancelled. If I want to see a movie I'll rent again at Redbox. The price is right and they are new releases.\n",

I had left Netflix out of a preference for other services like Amazon Prime, but I figured I'd give it another try (and see if any of the new content would make a longer-term subscription worth it). I clicked the link in the email and reached a page that told me that I am not eligible for a free trial after all. Figuring that must've been a mistake, I contacted customer service. They claimed they could do nothing, which was very frustrating. It seems terribly misleading (and blatantly dishonest) to send someone an email promising something and then say, \"Oops!

Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean) They always seem to have the majority of the movies except for one that's like right in the middle or the first movie in the series..

It gets so annoying to the point I have to unplug my device, wait, plug it back in and then try again. But oh no that doesn't work and it freezes again.

What their system wants to say is that customers always want to watch the first disc of a TV season before getting the second disc. So let's say that you have a 5 disc TV season in your queue. That's 5 individual discs. Netflix tags disc #1 as long wait and none of the discs for the season are shipped. But if you change the sequence in your queue from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 you will get 2 - 5 pretty much immediately and disc #1 is left hanging as \"long wait\".

I understand Netflix is in debt but is it really fair to say you're bumping the price up so you can add more movies?? Why can't you say \"we messed up by adding all these high rated movies and can't afford to pay out therefore we need you (the customers) to pull us out of debt\"?? Be honest with your customers!!! So once again I'm cancelling my subscription and going somewhere else!! Thanks Netflix!!!\n",

For example, some classics like The Break-Up and Sky High are just a small amount that I LOVE to watch whenever I feel like it. Netflix also took off The Titanic, which made me consider deleting my account altogether. So ATTENTION NETFLIX, you will be losing an extreme amount of publicity and popularity if you keep up with all of these removals. I might just end up having to switch to another company like Hulu or Vudu.\n",

What doesn't chap my cheeks, but does hinder my heart, is how there are only 8 episodes of The Defenders...

I'm frustrated with all the hours on the phone trying to get this straightened out. Some calls are routed overseas. Some agents are rude & incompetent.

I called Netflix several times to get it to stop and they said there was nothing they could (or would) do to stop every show from automatically starting.

      "review_text: I have noticed that I rarely go to Netflix anymore because it's difficult to browse. The new rating system is so useless that I naturally go to other providers. If I use Netflix, I have other provider websites open at the same time to get information, and it's a frustrating extra step. The \"percent match\" is not at all helpful. If my kids use my profile that's no longer valid and, more importantly, I don't care what Netflix thinks I'll like. We've been with Netflix for years and always liked it. Not anymore. \"Thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" is not valuable information. Movies aren't Facebook posts.\n",

I have only had a problem streaming once or twice and customer service was very responsive to that, quite quickly actually. I'm not happy about the price increases, but so far I have continued my subscription in spite of those simply because I would miss their programming if I canceled.\n",

I wanted All the President's Men and could not get it on streaming... also, I have chosen movies that have captioning and when I turn it on, the captioning is not there.

Remember, Netflix offers original movies and some of the most original series in the recent years. However, Netflix is only as good as your internet service. The question is often asked as to how good is the streaming of Netflix? Well, if you have poor internet service do not be surprised if you do not get the quality you might have expected when using Redbox or a DVD. Perhaps, that is why Netflix has tipped their hat to Xfinity to provide a larger viewing area and spread the broadband. I will not be so shocked to hear that Netflix will be gobbled up by Xfinity in the next year since corporations will be corporations. Righty will be tighty.

Why can’t they show all the seasons to the show? For example they only have 8-9 seasons of Heartland. The same is true with When Calls the Heat series. Where are the rest of the seasons of that show! Also the series Doc Martin where are the rest of the series!\n",

As for the price in this economy it should be at least $5.00 although the 9.00 about is not bad. There had been times in which I would have to cancel due to budget issues. They try and entice you by the free trial (which is very nice). They have disks that you can receive and charge more for that service which I understand.

Customer service is lacking and they would not let me speak with technical support when I asked even though I went through all their required steps. Netflix is a big rip off!!!\n",

      "review_text: Netflix was double charging me for 7 months. When I confronted them they would only refund me half of the amount after being a customer for 5 years. They are run by a computer system so if there is any problem whatsoever don't expect anyone from customer service to help you. They cannot assist you. They acted like I should be grateful for them refunding me half the amount. I would recommend Amazon prime. You get more movies. I am really disappointed in Netflix. I would not recommend them. I have cancelled my $16 month service for one screen (that is what I was being charged).\n",

Seem to magically go into wait status. I have been a Netflix subscriber almost since the company began; and, during the last five years, I have noticed a considerable decline in customer service. Don't bother calling them because the reps have a series of scripts that they are required to follow and you will likely not be satisfied with their answers to your queries. Get over it.

Breaking Bad and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which I have seen previously in their entirety, have been drastically cut. Important scenes have been cut in a draconian manner. The latter has been condensed into \"the Extended Version,\" which is not extended at all but, rather, cut severely. Their offerings have been reduced to garbage. I do not recommend this streaming service. Following their transfer of the Criterion Collection to FilmStruck, as their content has suffered. The American Public must be a bunch of retards to put up with this ridiculous emasculation of their originally excellent offerings. As a recent NYT article stated, \"What happened, Netflix?\"\n",

They need to stop using us to clean up their broken product. If they kicked out a disk as soon as it was reported, then maybe I would be satisfied but now I have to wait until they get the broken disk back to get another one sent.

I had a lengthy online chat exchange with a Netflix rep and was given the run-around with three different explanations as to why my Older Kids (max ratings TVPG) accounts were displaying programs rated TV14. Without giving you all the ridiculous details, the rep kept referring to the \"research team\" and it all boiled down to the fact that Netflix had either made errors entering the maturity rating for these shows or is intentionally steering younger audiences to more mature shows (Friends, which is basically a mature sitcom about sex, for example). BOTTOM LINE: Netflix parental controls do not function as advertised; they can't be trusted. PS The favoritism works in reverse too - some TVPG shows DON'T show up when they should as possible viewing choices for Older Kids even through the search function.\n",

Having received a $150 gift card at Christmas, I decided to open an account and become a regular user of the Netflix service. I attempted to watch movies, but for some odd reason, I could not connect to the service. After (3) days, I phoned Netflix's tech support for assistance. That turned out to be 2.50 hour call with no resolution. They tried to troubleshoot the problem but the final result was a verbal insult the agent didn't realize I could hear (when she thought the call was muted). That led to my request to cancel altogether. The worse part of this is that Netflix refused to refund the $150. They say their policy prevents them from refunding gift cards. I didn't ask for another gift card... I just wanted them to refund me the $150 VALUE of the card.\n",

I love how A-list actors are in so many of their series. It's interesting to see movie stars on a television series. The only problem I have with it is I keep having to unplug my dvr for 30 seconds and plug it back in because my picture freezes. I have to do this nearly once in every show. But I don't know if that's Netflix's fault, maybe my tv's too old or something. But I don't have that problem with regular cable tv. Anyway, Netflix is such a great value. You get a lot of quality entertainment for a small price.\n",

If the movie has a wait, don't expect to get it for at least 4-6 weeks. This was not the case even a year ago. Arrival has a Short Wait period and that currently means about 6 weeks. I have called twice, same response as the last complaint. Reminds me of Blockbuster, they always thought they were too big to go down. It's gotten to the point where I often get the movie on HBO or Star before I get the DVD then I cancel it. Also, whatever service they use for streaming is horrible. 50% of the time it's not in HD. My GF has Amazon, thankfully, we can generally get HD all of the time, and of course Comcast streaming which is always HD.\n",

The latest of their ever-evolving strategies is to feature a DVD COMING SOON category, sorted by release date... but purposely omit the most popular ones, hoping viewers won't notice the movie and request it. Their objective, I suspect, is to avoid spending money acquiring DVDs. You can often wait weeks for a newly released dvd, because their inventory is so low! Other strategies include reducing their work week from 6 to 5 days, closing Saturdays. They also slow acknowledgement of dvd receipt. If they receive your dvd on Friday... they may wait till Monday tell you it arrived. Pretty nasty.\n",

      "review_text: VPN Blocked Out!! We have been a Netflix customer since their beginning. We recently purchased an internet router and VPN service for security. Went the router way so we had whole home (all computers, TVs, etc, everything that uses the internet). Went to watch Netflix and they blocked us out, said we had to turn VPN off to watch anything on Netflix. So if dad wants to manage his investments securely no one in the house can watch Netflix at the same time? That is crazy so we are looking at Amazon, Hulu, and other alternatives. Be AWARE -- If you want whole home security you can't have it and Netflix at the same time!!!!\n",

Extremely unprofessional, lacking in their ability to listen to the customer because they are regurgitating the script to which they are told to adhere. Simple problems seem to befuddle them. I had a DVD plan which I wanted to switch to the streaming plan. I tried doing this 4+ times and it did not work. I called to get help. A kid named Dylan took the call. I explained the situation to him. He didn't listen to the fact that I had gone through all the steps necessary to change plans. He took me through them again, twice. As I was switching my phone to speaker so that I could type, he said \"Hey, If you're not going to ** talk to me I'm going to ** hand up on your **.\" I said, \"Excuse me?\" Then he started denying that he had spoken to me in that way. I always record customer service calls so that in case a call is dropped, I can call back and ask for the same person.\n",

New releases need to be added to your waiting list the minute they put them on unless you want to wait months for it.\n",

When you \"chat\" to anyone at Netflix about this you are just wasting your time - they try to confuse the simple issue with all sorts of nonsense. And for an internet service, guess what - no email facility or other way to get your concerns across. Talk about \"head in the sand\" - unbelievable in the 21st Century.

It offered new and refreshing shows and movies that were not readily available online or on cable channels with HD quality such as Jane the Virgin, Jessica Jones, How to Get Away with Murder, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Daredevil, etc. It was entertaining following such shows and I liked that Netflix recommended movies and shows based on my viewing preferences. That introduced me to similar shows that were worth checking out. Another good point is Netflix allows various users to create their own account and chose and save the shows they like.\n",

They have a great selection to choose from and I like how they can be filtered by category, making it easier to look for specific types of movies that I'm in the mood to see. I appreciate the site making movie suggestions based on what I've viewed recently and I find it awesome that they have so many original series of sorts to choose from. However, I noticed that they hardly have any Disney/Pixar movies available. I think it'd be great to see them available there as they're good for my daughter and nieces to watch, and myself too. But apart from that, Netflix has been a reliable companion during days or nights of free time and relaxation.\n",

Also when have both services can't add to your watch list a movie that is streaming when in the DVD portion - you can play it though. The website has become ridiculously difficult to use and is frustrating, diminishing the ease of watching movies - with the advent of using a laptop as a tablet NETFLIX has dropped the ball. They need to get website developers that know what they are doing. Considering dropping the service - searching for a movie should not take 20 mins.\n",

She said the problem is the limited amount of DVDs that Netflix is now producing. It is much cheaper for Netflix to stream. As a matter of fact, \"The Killing's\" four seasons are available via streaming. Unfortunately, for those of us who cannot obtain unlimited Internet in our area, streaming is too costly for our limited GBs. Another Netflix-produced series is \"House of Cards\". Its third season premiere was February 27. It has been at the #1 spot on my queue since it became available on DVD. I have yet to receive it -- 8 months later.\n",

      "review_text: I am sick and tired of Netflix's policy of \"suggesting\" dozens of titles to you just because you selected one title. That apparently gives them the right to suggest many, many titles of their choice that you have no choice but to go through until you can get to what you actually want! Now I'm adding to this. Why can't Netflix simply categorize movies as they really are? Is it really that difficult to distinguish between an English speaking movie and a foreign one? Apparently it is for Netflix who only cares about collecting their monthly fee, not earning it. Just in case you didn't get my point, I am totally disgusted with Netflix!!!\n",

If there were more settings (8 and under, 8-12, and 12-18) parents would be able to choose more appropriate shows for their children.\n",

And why did they tell me last night that it would be taken care of inside of 8 hours?\" They say they don't support Linux. I say they are lying about what's going on.\n",

      "review_text: I was a long time Netflix customer for many years and a Netflix stock investor. I have DVD plan and back in March of 2013 I returned the DVD as usual and waiting for my next DVD. I never received my subsequent DVD after 4 weeks went by. Called Netflix several times in April, May, June of 2013 but was told the DVD never arrived at the Netflix center. I was told that if it lost in the mail then the customer will have to pay for it before received the next one. I decided to cancel the DVD in July 2013 since Netflix did not sent me next DVD. In July 2013, I logged into the account and was not able to log in or cancel online. So I called the customer service and told them to cancel it. I was a very happy customer and had recommended Netflix to countless of people until this issue surfaced. Netflix continued to \"automatic deduct charges\" for the last 18 months despite no DVD send out to me for the last 21 months. When I call today, Netflix reply was that there was no record at all that I called and blamed everything on the customer. I lost trust in this company as a customer and an investor. \n",

I had a pleasant conversation with a Netflix rep about the possibility for changing my payment date. Though I understood they couldn't do that at the time, it was nice that they were able to tell me that and explain why rather than having a list of responses and just copying and pasting into the message field (which I wouldn't be surprised if some companies actually do). Netflix customer service really is some of the best service and help you can get. I'd say their help surpasses that of Xfinity/Comcast. Attached is a recent chat transcript so you can see how friendly they really are. \n",

I have been with netflix for years and have been happy with them until I tried to get a year subscription from them. After having to call them, as I couldn't find the subscriptions in my account, I had to call them. I was told they no longer do subscriptions but I could look up who was selling gift cards and could purchase them. He wasn't even sure who had them but did say he thought Best Buy. I told him that I had been getting my year subscriptions from them, which he had confirmed I had, but said that they were no longer able to do that. He didn't know why and said this must be something new they are doing. Usually you got a discount for buying a year in advance, which ran under $100. But now they only sell gift cards in $30 and $60 increments which with them raising new subscriptions to around $11 a month, you can't even get a year unless you get 2 cards at $60 dollars and one more at $30 dollars. \n",

She empathized with me and instructed me to call the Phone Call Center and said they would likely be able to help me. I Googled online and can see that people have received refunds before. On the phone, I spoke with a man who promised to help, asked me to go back into my office (I had been standing in the hall making the call while at work) and I had to Google my local TD Bank's phone number.

Another bothersome thing is that when I do a search on a favorite actor, the results are their lesser known, lesser successful movies.

For example, from the get-go, you call and regularly have you wait no more than a minute and the reps are always professional and do help you to resolve issues. If you receive a damaged disc, they will send a replacement plus an extra disc. One complaint has to do with the fee for ordering Blu-ray discs. I have a Blu-ray disc player but have never used a Blu-ray disc. I asked if I could order a disc, see if I like the Blu-ray effect and thereby decide if it would be worth it to subscribe to their Blu-ray program. \"No. No. Cannot. You have to pay the general fee.\" What would be so difficult about allowing a customer to try it out, for a small fee? All of that kind of stuff is a matter of programming computers, which shouldn't be like programming a rocket launch to the moon, FGS!\n",

The terms for free trial offer CLEARLY says that card will be charged at the end of the free trial offer.... I’M PISSED. IDKY THEY OVERCHARGED MY ACCT NOR EVEN CHARGED IT AT ALL.\n",

When there is a movie you actually want to see, you get an error code - this movie is not available at this time or it is very, very slow! They have no email to contact them about problems. When you call them and complain, it's, \"I'm sorry.\" That's it, no incentives - nothing to keep your business. Soon they will be like Blockbusters - out of business!!! Get with the times and with the competition, Netflix. Soon, you will hear... What's Netflix?\n",

I pay for 4 disks at a time, and Netflix is making their best effort to delay shipments in such a way as to prevent me from getting more disks a week. Netflix, just be honest with your customers, pull the false advertising and quit manipulating the shipments.\n",

I immediately called Netflix to cancel one of them and see about a credit or refund for the extra 3 payments that were made. Both the customer service rep and his higher up stuck to the Netflix rule of only granting one credit since it \"wasn't their fault\". Despite the fact that they received payment twice 3 months in a row for the same household. The manager apologized and said it was their policy. He also said that the customers need to be responsible. I explained that it was an oversight on our end but that they still were paid twice regardless. I would have been satisfied with 3 credits to our account. We have been customers for a number of years. Instead I canceled both accounts and won't utilize their service again. Better luck to anyone else should you have Netflix issues!\n",

I have multiple times watched a movie only to find it missing when I recommend it to a friend. These - off the top of my head- include Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Cowboy Bebop and various others.

Netflix seems to want it all without the expense of building their own CDNS (Content Delivery Network Servers). Instead Netflix should be building far more regionally located Netflix CDN Servers to meet their customer demand and not relying on the ISPs to shoulder the load.

Spoke to supervisor - double billing because I inputted my email address incorrectly by one letter which setup additional account. Supervisor says nothing he can do, his system doesn't allow a refund more than one month (crock of **. I thought what a scam). You enter CC info, name and password and there sftw doesn't flag you for account already used. BS. I cancelled on the spot. What a scam.\n",

EVERY time my family and I attempt to watch a movie on Netflix, it locks up, has that stupid loading logo, says that the title is not available even though we just watched a part of that very movie, tells me to try another title - and I do, and it STILL does not work. And I'm tired of it. I would expect that with the money we are paying for their terrible service (and their customer service website is awful) that they would do better. Nope. And after reading some of the complaints on here from other customers, I can see that I am not the only one that has a problem. I know it is not our internet connection, because any other streaming service other than Netflix, works fine. It has also become apparent that Netflix doesn't give a damn about their customers either.\n",

I got my account back when they were offering streaming and DVD in the same package for just $10.00/month. Honestly, It was a deal. I took advantage of that service and still do, only without the DVDs. The stream selection was good enough and the DVD selection made up for what the stream was lacking. I ended up having a lot of free time after work and weekends, due to putting myself on a strong no spending, cut debt program. So Netflix served as great entertainment for those days spent at home. I would invite friends over and we would watch movies on stream or I would get a DVD within days. Overall, my experience was positive. I never had an experience of a DVD been lost in the mail or anything like that. The stream has crashed a couple of times since I've had it but no big deal.\n",

But from my experience, as long as your read the fine print, follow directions and cancel in the allotted trial time, you shouldn't have any problems.\n",

      "review_text: I've tried several times to have a stable Netflix streaming-only account. For the first few months, all goes well. Monthly payments go smoothly. Suddenly, I see double payments showing up on my bank account. I try to clear it up. For a while, all goes well, until two payments for one month show up a few days apart in the same billing cycle. I cancel... then later, I try again, but the same thing happens. I added the cheapest DVD account they have, hoping to solve the problem. Their computer would surely be tripping over itself with two streaming-only accounts and plus one DVD account on one computer. Outrageous results, but I instigated it, knowing that their accounting on my service was screwed up. \n",

Netflix says they have no record of the double billing or of the reference numbers. They tell you to blame the credit card company. There are a lot of other people complaining about this on the web. If you try to kill the account and open another account, they continue to bill the first account as well as the new account.

I sent the DVD directly from the post office, 3-5 days before I cancelled my DVD free-trial membership. I just checked my account; I was charged for my streaming membership (as usual) AND for an \"unreturned\" DVD. I received no email, no phone call, nothing at all warning me that I'd be charged for a DVD that I mailed out but they didn't receive. They are refunding me, but I don't appreciate them charging me automatically for something that I do not have to pay for (if I wanted to keep a DVD, I can get 3 DVDs for $5 at the barber shop, lol). I very rarely check my account charges. If I wouldn't have checked, I wouldn't have ever seen the charge. I don't like that at all.\n",

We used our smart TV, Wii, Play Station and iPads to use Netflix. I moved my cards to my husband's accounts and while checking the statements realized we had two Netflix charges.

Too many old movies, not enough recent ones. Today, 6-5-2013, I found three months of fees taken from my credit card. I called Netflix to ask for a full refund. I was told that only one month's fees would be refunded. I was told that this policy is in the fine print of the terms and conditions. Additionally, Netflix is not violating the law by keeping money for services not rendered to me. I have removed Netflix from my Christmas card list forever.

      "review_text: This has to do with the \"save queue\". Many shows and movies have to go to this queue because Netflix does not release them in a timely fashion. I was told that if you put a show or movie in this \"save queue\" you will be sent your DVD in the order in which the save request was received. So the earlier you request this, the sooner the item should arrive. Not so! They let the item out a day sooner than posted, and it goes to their preferred clients or employees, but not the general public, some of whom, like myself waited for over 6 months patiently. I canceled their service and will never return. This is more than maddening, but the basis of very bad business - all of those years being overcharged for this service and then to be treated so unfairly! If they don't survive, here is an excellent reason why. This is discrimination, pure and simple.\n",

Today, I received an email on an inactive and very old email address advising me that my credit card on file at Netflix had expired and they were about to cancel my account. Well, that card number was cancelled four months ago. So thinking it was some sort of illegal activity, I called customer supportless only to find to my dismay that I have been paying for two accounts for over a year. Sound familiar? Well, you guessed it. They don't intend to refund more than the current billing period even though they confirmed that I had not used the old (other) account in at least a year. God only knows how long I had been paying for two accounts. That states volumes for online credit card statements. Having four credit cards, I wasn't smart enough to realize that I was paying twice each month since the statements come in on the beginning and last week of each month. What can one do? I noticed that I am not alone in this double billing of multiple accounts thing. They must love fools such as me. Folks, beware and pay attention to your charges.\n",

When I called them up, they could only refund me the last month of December. That's their policy! If I want all my refunds, I have to dispute through my bank, which makes very inconvenient and time consuming. Please be aware that when you cancel your account with Netflix, keep checking your bank to make sure you don't get charged. It does not matter if you have a confirmation email, they still take no responsibility.\n",

When this December I had 2 DVDs out, I called and was told they were having a mailing problem. Then just this past week, I called again to tell them I was still receiving the message that I needed to correct my email. That is when I was told I was paying for two plans!

Christina was sarcastic and was mocking me with that little laughter thing that customer service reps do when they want to make fun of their customers. I phoned them and Hulu on March 15, 2012 to change my billing date. Hulu was very accommodating, even though I could have completed my request on their website. The rep was considerate enough to walk me through the process, with clarity and excellent customer service. On the other hand, I got nothing but bad attitude from the Netflix rep. Before calling them, I checked their website and logged into my account to ascertain if their site was user-friendly for making the changes to my account. It was not.\n",

In the last few years, Netflix has really gone downhill from being an industry leader and innovator to a joke of marketing incompetence. I've been a member since 2002 and have been very satisfied for most of that time, even choosing to remain patient and loyal during the whole \"Qwikster\" debacle. But in recent months, three changes I've noticed are really making it hard for me to remain a customer: (1) Fewer and fewer streaming options, despite them gearing the website to make it more difficult to add DVDs; (2) more \"long wait\" delays for many DVDs (for instance, my entire Christmas queue is flagged. That never used to happen, even during seasonal periods of high demand); and (3) longer turnaround times to receive DVDs by mail.\n",

I was being billed twice a month for adjustments in their billing process, sadly, throwing my bank account overdrawn costing me. I've rented two DVDs in three months and had been double billed for each month. Instead of realizing perhaps they have gotten their money's worth out of those two DVDs, they insist that customers are more than advised as to each of the DVDs and streaming being 8 dollars each. It used to be combined as I recall, but instead of just refunding just one charge for one month (not a lot for what I've actually paid in three months) totaling just 7 movies total both steaming and DVD, it's sad to say that they were more than happy to ditch a paying customer over $8 and taking time to listen with at least pretending to care.\n",

Also offered was streaming which I recently signed up for on a free trial and saw the price to be $8 after expiration of trial without DVDs. The first thing I had to do was download a proprietary Microsoft Silverlight, which is a memory hog and simply freezes up the dual processor laptop. Fast hard drive, high power multimedia processor and an expensive internet cable connection. Before I got to the failed Silverlight delivery, I noticed an anemic interface with virtually nothing there that I wanted to view. I selected a movie that I'd seen before and after an hour of several failed attempts, the movie loaded. \n",

This is concerning as one who would like to rent these whether I'm a Christian or not. They are good family oriented films if nothing else. Furthermore, I have also noticed Blockbuster carries a great deal more (whether they have them is another matter and I am by no means advocating or promoting BB) but they do offer more excellent Christian Christmas movies including recent releases. I am re-evaluating whether to continue my subscription. Netflix, I sincerely hope you listen to these complaints as they are valid.

The service I received was the bare minimum, and rather than illustrating that Netflix values their customer through refunding the double charges or providing months at no charge because they were already paid for, Netflix showed they do not care about their customer, but rather only for their money. So Netflix lost me as a customer, which is a shame, because it would have been no out of pocket to them. Just as well, I'd rather not contribute to their greedy mentality.\n",

Initially the whole plan for almost $10 with streaming and one Blu-ray DVD at a time was the best value.

About 3 weeks ago, I decided to use the DVD one at a time Blu-ray subscription to watch the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. I watched the Walking Dead 1st DVD season 2 then found it on demand on AMC and I watched the rest of it there. On to Game of Thrones.

I owned Netflix stock for several years because of their excellent customer service. I would not recommend the stock or the service to anyone at this point!\n",

      "review_text: I am on trial basis with Netflix. I really like everything with the exception of the background sound/noise/music in some programs. It is so loud and overpowering. One has great difficulty understanding the audio. In some cases, I have been unable to make out the spoken word. Gallaudet Research Institute indicates 44% of folks over 55 years old have hearing problems. My research indicates Netflix does not add the noise and has no control over it. I would be willing to pay more for Netflix programs without the disgusting background music. I hope this will get to proper authorities who may have input.\n",

I got up, leaving my 5 year old on the couch in front of the TV. When you flip through movies on Netflix, it will show clips from the movie. When I got up to get my little one, I came back to find the movie clip showing was extremely inappropriate. There were 2 girls getting their clothing torn off at knife point by some men. The girls were mostly nude and were forced to \"do things\". I was in shock to see that my 5 year old was watching this! The movie is \"The Last House on the Left\" 1972 version. I do not have a problem with this sort of movie, but with the clip that was shown for the movie. I'm sure they could choose a different clip for that movie so that no other children will be exposed to this. I called and spoke to a woman at Netflix. I was told they have no control over what clips are shown nor do they preview the clips before putting them on Netflix. She told me she would send a note and make them (whoever them is) aware of this. That was 3 weeks ago and nothing has changed!\n",

I understand that movie ratings are a 'guide' for parents to use, and I realize that children can use the \"kids\" link to access appropriate content, but there are no mechanisms for parents to \"block\" content such as this from accidental access. Apple has a fairly strict process for preventing kids from accessing \"explicit content\", but Netflix does not and that is really surprising to me. I think you need to come up with a more family friendly process for using you services on computers, home entertainment systems, mobile devices etc., and enable specific blocking of content. It also wouldn't hurt for you to establish some sort of \"adult\" tier that is not accessible without additional effort by adults.\n",

I am seriously thinking about cancelling the subscription and then just using the Redbox like everyone else. The only thing that keeps me from doing this is that sometimes I want to watch an older movie. So where do I go for that? Blockbuster is an extinct species. Ugh.\n",

      "review_text: I am a \"one-disc-at-a-time\" subscriber to Netflix and frequently get defective discs. For example, a month ago, I ordered Mad Men (Season 1, Disc 1). It was defective. I sent it back, and they sent a replacement supposedly. I never saw it. They told me later it was damaged in shipment and returned to them. I requested a third copy. It was fine. Tonight, I went to watch Disc 2. It's defective. And yes, I cleaned and polished it, and it still won't play. So I wait another 5 days for a replacement. It does no good to call Netflix, which cannily has no email address so you can give them some substantive information on the problem. It's frustrating. They have poor customer service. CEO Reed Hastings sends us YouTube videos when he wants to reach us, but he gives us no way to reach him.\n",

      "review_text: I understand and accept the splitting of the streaming and DVD to home services where the charges are like $7.99 plus tax for each. Having said that, the only ways that you can pay is either through direct monthly charges to one's bank account, credit card, or by buying a paid subscription and then redeeming that subscription so that the monthly charges are deducted from it. The deducted charges from the subscription are not itemized, and so, you do not know exactly what you have left over. Why do they have to make it so difficult? Why can't they just have a way of paying using a credit card, debit card, or bank account where you can buy for instance 12 months in advance for the services you have chosen in your account? It is almost like Netflix is trying to hide earnings from the government, and the way that they charge, it would be very easy to do and the government tax bean counters could never figure it out. There is something not right with Netflix's billing system, and someone needs to take a look into the books.\n",

      "review_text: Streaming Netflix has three gaping flaws. One, they provide very poor content to the streaming users. This crap should be free, and is free with a service like Hulu. Two, they have a nearly criminal policy when it comes to monthly fees, such as charging bank accounts periodically after cancellation and forcing membership via the one-month trial hook, sometimes failing to honor the trial cancellation. Three, their advertising is intentionally ambiguous when it comes to the stream vs. DVD differences. If you want a lot of cartoons for your child because you don't have cable and hate watching PBS Barney and Sid the Science Kid, then this is for you. If you love to explore a small selection of B movies, then this is for you. If you like being yelled at over the phone by the same people who are stealing from you, then this is for you.

      "review_text: So I had to resign and join even though I been with Netflix for a long time. I tried 3 times. Finally, after the 3rd time, Netflix got $16.38 with tax plus $8.40 for 3 DVDs out at a time with unlimited streaming. They took $40.76 but when I called customer service, I was told $15.98 was on hold and would come back after 3 days. It has not come back to me and I am mad and never going to sign up for their DVD plans again. They have the worst billing practices ever. I am writing to warn people about this problem not to rent from them or Redbox too. Worst companies ever!\n",

      "review_text: I enjoyed watching Naruto, Bleach, and Inuyasha. However, yesterday, they were all gone. Only Naruto was there but season 1 and part of season 2 had disappeared. I would like to know why and I would like it if you will put them back on. Those were the only reasons why I joined Netflix. I wished at least there was information to let us know what shows you were taking away. I hoped that that could have made the situation better. I would just beg for you to put them back. It might have nothing to do with this, but watching those shows was the only time I could relax. And I think that is what Netflix is supposed to do. It is supposed to entertain people. That is what I thought and hoped it was supposed to be. Please consider my thoughts. Thank you.\n",

We went through all the sign up process, including entering a Visa number to register. Last month, my card was compromised and was cancelled. As I do not own a credit card now, Netflix sent me an email telling me my account was suspended as of April 1, 2012. I called customer service and spoke with a gentleman who informed me even though I had already paid for the 6-month service with a gift certificate, I needed a new credit card so they could get authorization each month. I told him that if I got a prepaid credit card, I would have to pay the fees on the card to get my already paid service. He said yes. \n",

It's bait-and-switch, with a misleading headline. The streaming content is vastly inferior to what is on DVD. Netflix never explains why all their best films are limited to DVDs, which must be a lot more expensive for them to mail out than streaming.\n",

I have several friends who subscribe to Netflix and they are totally satisfied. I am a subscriber as well and I enjoy every bit of it. I apologize if I offend anyone but what more do you expect for $7.99? Popcorn? As for picture quality, If you don't have a good ISP, maybe you're better off waiting or switching to a provider who offers better bandwidth. I personally stream Netflix on my TV but sometimes I log in with my laptop and I have no issues, even when I'm streaming wireless. As for the movies/shows, I am certain you can always find something that will suit you. Try being a bit more open. Browse through their huge collection and keep track of what you watch and add it up at the end of the month. See what it would of cost you if you went elsewhere. Just weigh the pros and cons for their service. Do you really think your losing out for $7.99?\n",

We've been a customer with Netflix for years, so we are very disappointed that they only offered us a credit for $3. That is, 25% off the monthly fee - only 1 week for free. We are very disappointed! We expected at least one month for free! They have bad customer service!\n",

When a DVD is sent damaged, they offer a replacement DVD as a customary practice.  Since the membership is charged monthly, sending an additional DVD does not eliminate the issue.  Netflix continues to profit while customers simply get poor service.  Only on a few occasions did a representative offer a partial discount.  \n",

I've been a customer long before anyone even knew what Netflix was and yet I am finally fed up. I think their price hike is a stupid business move and they'll upset enough people eventually to lose out on the great thing they had going. The only thing that is stopping me from canceling is the expensive Roku that I bought and installed a week before their rate hike was announced. Blahh! Netflix, you disappoint!\n",

The customer service representative would not do anything about it, saying this was in the terms of the gift agreement. A 6-month gift card is just that. They shouldn't continue robbing your checking account after that. What can I do? I was charged $9.69 for about 18 months and no movies were being sent because we assumed his \"gift\" was used up. I feel they owe me at least $200.00 back.\n",

I noticed that I was continued to be charged for the months of August through November.

They would only credit the month of Oct. and Nov. I spoke to a manager named John, he said unless I could show them my email cancellation from them acknowledging my 7/11 cancellation, they would do nothing about Aug. and Sept. \n",

I just found out yesterday that Netflix has been sending DVDs to my friend for the past few months even though my card was expired and I have a different credit card number. I have read about similar incidents where Netflix has collected money from the subscribers bank due to the expired credit card. I cancelled service last night.

      "review_text: After I canceled my membership with Netflix I kept receiving offers to subscribe again. Finally, when I received a one-month free trial offer, I decided it was time to give the service another try. They charged my card right away and when I called to ask why they told me the offer was for new subscriptions, but that was never clear to me during the subscription. Well, Netflix, I hate companies that try to take advantage of people thru sleaziness and fine print. You will never hear from me again and I will make sure nobody I know subscribes to Netflix.\n",

      "review_text: I have been using Netflix since 2005 and at some point in the last couple of years they changed the format that allowed the consumer to find \"new releases\". That has added a lot of confusion and lead to a situation where I have to use a different website to find the names of the movies that are released on DVD each Tuesday (typically all DVD releases are on Tuesday). It is almost impossible to click \"Browse - New Releases\" to find an actual \"New Release\" or \"New Arrival\". The list of movies I have had in my queue for a very long time and have been released as far back as December 2009 and yet still say \"very long and long wait\" is growing more and more - especially since the beginning of the year. The list of movies I have been waiting 1, 2, 3 and even 4 months for has grown to about 15 deep at this point. I currently do not have the ability to watch the movies \"instantly\" online, so that feature is not at all of use to me. \n",

      "review_text: The Netflix streaming service (Watch Instantly), which is available on PS3, is overwhelmed with movies that glorify drugs and/or sexual material. This is not the adult version of Netflix. As a parent, I find it wholly irresponsible that Netflix does not filter this type of adult-oriented content from its streaming service but rather automatically populates the movie queue as new movies become available. This is a disservice to parents that do not want their kids exposed to a distasteful movie line up that can be watched instantly. My wife and I cannot search for movies with our daughter present because every other movie has a glorified drug or sexual title or movie cover. This is absurd for a service that is widely available and accessible by kids, especially on gaming consoles (i.e, PS3, Xbox). Netflix does not offer a search option whatsoever on the PS3 Netflix service, which forces consumers to look at every single movie to find one to watch, making it impossible to bypass inappropriate movies. This is unacceptable and a direct failure of the Netflix service to provide consumers with effective control of the content being displayed.\n",

I waited and waited and waited, but the status never changed from Very Long Wait for more than two months. I ended up renting all of the new releases I wanted to watch on iTunes after waiting for two months. I decided to leave those movies in my queue and watched what happened for another month. They are still in 'Very Long Wait' status. Unbelievable and it's not acceptable. I think they are buying a lot less DVDs and want us to watch old and mediocre movies on instant play.

The supervisor Carl continued to repeat himself and was of no value. Carl only wanted a new subscription to be restarted for the service, that had already been paid for, to be used. He wanted me to pay twice for one service. Netflix canceled a prepaid subscription, did not refund the money for the unused time and severely misled their customer. Netflix is clearly only interested in making sales and not retaining customers.\n",

The policy states no charges will be made to your card unless you do not return the DVDs.

I clicked verify and made my selection.  Then I tried to use my credit card the next day only to discover the bank had placed a hold on it. It seems Netflix attempts to charge $1.00 to your card each month to verify the card is still valid.  The Credit card company sees this activity as fraudulent and puts a hold on your card, then cancels your card and re-issues a new one to prevent further fraud.  Now, I have to wait 7 days to get a valid card replacement.  Netflix does not advise you of this procedure in advance so you can advise the credit card company. I have 2 months left on my gift subscription but Netflix refuses to honor it until I give them another credit card to replace the one they managed to get canceled for me.   \n",

      "review_text: Why doesn't Netflix allow customers to go online and cancel the service by not renewing their automatic credit card charge? Instead, the only option is to cancel your account immediately, so you lose any time left in the 30-day cycle and have to send any DVDs you have back within seven days or they'll charge your credit card for them. Isn't the consumer ENTITLED to finish out the rest of their subscription, since they've paid for it?  I did reach them by phone, and the rep said he had no way to end the subscription by not renewing the charge on my credit card, the fair and honest way. The only way to end the subscription is for the consumer to cancel immediately while online. This is a very rude, extremely unhelpful, and unfriendly way to treat supposedly valued customers! Isn't there a law against this kind of one-way approach? So now I have to remember to go online and cancel before my card is charged on November 10. The benefit of this policy is all for them; the consumer is left feeling very unhappy about the experience.\n",

The two DVDs I have gotten that were scratched were SO scratched that I can't imagine the previous viewer hadn't noted it. Their \"compensation\" is to send you another copy of the movie, but that's not really all that great, given that one \"gets into\" a movie and once the mood is lost, picking it up a few days later, when one has the time, well... it's not the same. \n",

This happened more than a few times, and they only offered to replace it, not refund any of the monthly fee of $22. I figured I was receiving one defective DVD for every five good ones, a bad ratio, esp. if the skipping begins somewhere after an hour into the movie.The straw that broke the camel's back was they sent me a replacement (one I had viewed for nearly the entire film) that didn't play at all. Their customer service people aren't reasonable, and if you tend to rent out a lot of DVDs over the month, they'll put you into a delayed churn, trying to get you to cancel because they're not making a profitable margin off you.\n",

Since then, every new release I request is at least a short wait and most are a long or very long wait (which amounts to 2-3 months to receive the DVD requested). No matter the price, nobody wants to wait 3 months to view a new release - especially when you can run down to Blockbuster and rent it within a week of its release. Netflix has a monthly churn rate of 7% which means they lose 84% of their customers annually - a recipe for disaster and if they hope to remain in existence, they should ensure they have enough of the new releases on hand to satisfy all of their subscribers.\n",

You can binge watch series that you may have wanted to watch but didn't want to watch from season 4. Just start it at season 1 and go. Don't have to be at home, you just take it with you. Sit outside by your pool and still watch your favorite movie. Netflix is up on new movies. Adding new ones everyday. They also show you what you might be interested in by what you watch. A big variety of new movies and series as well as old ones you might have forgotten. Need to take advantage of Netflix versus cable or satellite TV.\",\n",

Netflix has a perfect user friendly service that even a three year old can use. Netflix is Personal. It's like a friend. Did you know Binge watching was a thing? Well I didn't until I watched The Good Witch series when I was sick in bed, Episode after Episode. I was hooked on Netflix. I think it actually made me feel better quicker? I don't know of any other services that can do that. I know I would be heartbroken if Netflix ever ended its Service or let some other company take them over.\",\n",

While the interface groups into genres I find it just keeps showing they same titles. I absolutely HATE how \"new releases\" are really \"New to Netflix\" I want NEW as in THIS YEAR at least. IF the genre listings took into account shows I a. watched (all of it) and/or b. rated as liked and then prioritized in those genre listings I would find it more valuable. Also if I had control over which lists/genres list & their filters that would be even better.',\n",

She was very courteous and helpful. (Forgot her name, was it Michelle!) Turned out had to update password! As far as viewing is concerned, would appreciate if Netflix could do something about options regarding how many person could view at the same time. And how persons could log into their own \"page\" or whatever they call it. I have a Roku, and my daughter owns the Netflix account, but on Roku, I can log onto to my own page!

The whole reason for going to streaming was to alleviate those commercials. Although not having commercials, I find I am not going to the fridge as much and thus have lost weight... win/win. Also on Hulu, if you stop the program you are watching, you have to start over again and find the place where you ended. Very poor. I also am currently on Prime through a promo. I have not been impressed with Prime. But that may be my inability to travel around the Prime conglomerate. All to say is that I came back to Netflix and it has everything that I need or want at this point in time.',\n",

So what is it?\",\n",

Kind of tired about hearing about all the great content they deliver as every time they raise their fees for standard service by a $1.00 per month, they gross another $200 million per month or $2.4 Billion annually based upon their approximately 200 million customers. For that kind of cash, they should offer much better!',\n",

And this is embarrassing to admit but I also needed something playing to help me sleep, I only had Netflix so I used it next to all of the time.

Having this type of movie listed under its own menu heading would help people like me avoid confusion and irritation. I'd also like it if they could get more series and movies.

However, if it is something we don't like, it is very easy to stop watching and find something new and better. This programming certainly beats watching all the advertising of normal television. I know there has to be advertising but 8 to 9 spots in a normal half hour show is too much. Thank you.\",\n",
       "  'You watch a movie to see how it ends. Too often Netflix just ends it before it is over. They are adding too many foreign speaking movies. I have to check up to 4 movies to find one that is an English speaking show. Good shows are getting to be harder to find. I have canceled one TV and I am thinking about cancelling the last one.',\n",
       "  'I enjoy the ability to binge watch an entire series. Most of the time suggestions are interesting. There is a lot that I do not watch, however. Overall, Netflix is providing solid viewing choices in that I can usually find something to watch.',\n",

       "  \"Netflix used to be the end all be all. I'm not sure what happened, but the content pool continually gets smaller. Decent movies cycle in and out and low quality movies stay forever. There isn't a way to filter out what you've already watched, so you see the same movies over and over, even if you've rated them poorly, to give the illusion that there are more choices than there actually are. Cancelled my subscription. Will re-up for a few months when Stranger Things comes back on, but will cancel afterward.\",\n",

My friend who has cable never has anything he wants to watch but I can watch anything at any time with Netflix. Their Netflix own produced shows are really great like Frankie and Grace and Orange is the New Black. The only thing lacking is they don't have a lot of movies if you have the internet version. You have to subscribe to the disc version to be sent to your house. The two subscriptions would make it too expensive for me so I just stick to Netflix on the laptop and go to Redbox where I can get instant gratification cheaper for movies. Overall for the selections available Netflix is a great buy and I would not give it up.\",\n",

       "  \"They dont let you know if the show has subtitles. They got rid of the ratings because 90% of the content is crap. It seems anybody with a GoPro can make a movie and Netflix shows it. Some of their series are good and that's the only reason I subscribe.\",\n",
       "  \"Netflix is pretty good streaming shows and also have better movies than Hulu Plus, however I don't like the fact that can't stream from the night before.\",\n",

       "  'Netflix is a great online streaming media. Movies load great and play from beginning to end with no problem. I am disappointed in their selections. Big name star movies are few and far between. Even older movies with big stars are few. I would like to see a better selection of movies available.',\n",

       "  'The movies in Netflix are not current and it takes me a while to find one. If a movie has sequel to it, it should have all of them, not just 1. Some of the selections are not good.',\n",

The quality is beautiful, if you have some problem to see Netflix, you call customer services and they will fix the problem in less than 10 minutes. My family like Netflix and all of them are happy as well.\",\n",
       "  \"Netflix has a lot of movies and TV shows to choose from. I got to watch some of them but they don't have some of the movies I wanted to watch. But it's better than renting from Redbox.\",\n",

       "  'I really like Netflix but as with everything there is always room for improvement. I would like to see more popular, mainstream movies in the new releases and recently added categories in contrast to the numerous oddities that keep popping up. Also, stop sending me messages saying there are new episodes of a series I had been watching, only to find out that I have already viewed these episodes.',\n",
       "  \"Netflix is a great source for international films and documentaries not available in the premium channels or missed because of scheduling conflicts. Their own productions are of highest quality as they address present issues and concerns. There are a wide variety of shows to choose from and I can watch them whenever I want. They can improve if they can offer a personalized page for feedback from their customers. Their method of feedback is limited and I'm afraid future forecasts will be not reflective of customer choices. Overall this is a good network that others are trying to follow.\",\n",
       "  'I like quite a variety of movies, television shows & even self help programs and I have found all of it on Netflix! I think the variety of programming is excellent & the price is an excellent value!',\n",
       "  \"I really felt very interested when my brother subscribed to Netflix last year when he bought a plasma TV and installed it on our kitchen wall. I had my cable TV in my room disconnected and PlayStation 3 was hooked up and I discovered Netflix. The screen had hundreds of movies, TV shows or any show in different genre you can think of and the first one that I was really excited about watching was anime and I was hooked on that show The Gilmore Girls. They had it all. I was caught up watching the Walking Dead because I'm watching it on my laptop and NETFLIX has the new Gilmore Girls. Nowhere else could I ever had watched it anywhere but on Netflix.\",\n",
       "  'Overall, we are happy with Netflix, regarding price and genres, but we would really like to see more turnover. Some of the movies have been on Netflix for years. The quality is usually fairly decent, but some of the horror options are done in the theme of students filming experiences and those are almost always very poorly made and redundant, and that the plot is repetitive.',\n",
       "  'Love, love, love Netflix. They have great movies, documentaries and tv shows and especially original Netflix productions. I wish they carried more current tv shows like Hulu does but I love that Netflix is commercial free so will stick with it.',\n",

       "  \"Netflix has been a wonderful addition to our house. I love watching new series and some that have been around a while have turned out to be our new favorites! Binge watching may be considered a downside by some, but I love it - the only downside is when I get to the end of the series and then have to wait for the new season to be posted! I also love that I've been introduced to a variety of shows from across the pond - we have several favorites from England and even one from Russia (which was a huge surprise to us as it uses subtitles - but after the first few we were hooked!).\",\n",

       "  'Netflix needs more of a balance, most everything on it is targeted for the younger audience. Even if you write or call to request programs, it does not do any good. Not all of us want to see trashy, pervert shows that claim a \"family friendly\" rating! If a better streaming site comes along, it\\'s goodbye Netflix!',\n",
       "  'Netflix allows me the convenience of watching different shows when I want, plus watch my old favorites. It has worked out well for me and the price is reasonable.',\n",

       "  \"Netflix is what I watch the most. Of course I would like more movies and shows, but I find the most diverse shows for the whole family. It's the easiest to maneuver. I especially like the ability to go right back to where I stopped on a show. I highly recommend Netflix.\",\n",
       "  'I love the fact that I can call them anytime and let them know my interest and they will tailor my choices according to what I am interested in!!! The experience is best on high speed internet. We no longer have cable.',\n",

       "  \"Netflix needs more of a selection and need to show newer movies. They don't change their movie list often enough. Netflix is redundant on showing what movies they are showing. When you scroll down through their list of movies, you see the same movie in different locations.\",\n",
       "  'Would like to see more old television shows that you can\\'t get elsewhere such as shows from the 60\\'s, 70\\'s and 80\\'s. There were some available before - such as the original Battlestar Galactica- but they have been taken off.

Also the tv shows, I appreciate how you can watch all of the old and new episodes and the selection is awesome. I can't forget the availability of new released movie. The timing is wonderful. And finally the Netflix original movies are great, I love seeing actors that hasn't had any recent movies that are in the theater. Thanks Netflix. Who needs cable when we have Netflix.\",\n",
       "  \"I joined Netflix 13 years ago, and during that time, they treated me with courtesy, and made me feel important; although, there was not a two way communication.There wasn't an option to really say anything- to ask questions, or complain directly. There were ways to report damages & such, but only in their words, not my own. And the rating-system was really dumb.\",\n",

       "  'I like the variety of Netflix and that I can \"downgrade\" the cost to something more appropriate for a single user, 1 lowD TV (720) and no cell phone. I loved the full 1 month free trial even though I\\'d signed up once before and never used it. But Hulu would not allow me to try a full 30 days because I\\'d once signed up for a 2 wk. trial 2 years prior and they knew I\\'d never used it. Only one complaint - Netflix asks me to sign in whenever Verizon\\'s modems need replacing because I cannot get FIOS and am stuck with a copper landline (no Dish nor Cable TV).',\n",

Several months ago, every time I was looking through the different shows to find something to watch, every one I looked at would automatically start playing and the volume was really loud. It made it impossible for me to browse to find what I wanted to watch next because it was so distracting and loud and every time I switched to a different show it started all over again. I called Netflix several times to get it to stop and they said there was nothing they could (or would) do to stop every show from automatically starting. It was so frustrating I cancelled my subscription. It seems like now that Netflix is so big they don't care about customer satisfaction anymore. I don't understand why they wouldn't offer an option to opt out of new things they are trying.\",\n",

       "  \"Netflix don't have a good variety of new TV, movies or shows, the only thing keeping them alive is Netflix original shows.

It's time to upgrade Netflix, you are losing a lot of people because of Roku, Fire Stick.\",\n",

The shows on Netflix are high quality and I look forward to new seasons of all my favorites especially Orange is the New Black and Sense8. It is a good addiction! I exercise and do housework while shows are playing! I expect Netflix to grow so I invested my money in their stock.\",\n",

I\\'ve not done a deep, full analysis, but it just \"feels\" like many classics are missing. Also, their new \"thumbs-up\"... \"thumbs-down\" rating system just sucks. All that work I put into the five-star rating system has vanished. I\\'ll stick with Netflix, but it is highly over-rated.',\n",
